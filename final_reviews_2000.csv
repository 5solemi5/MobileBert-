Review,Rating
hurrah finally i had my first radiohead experience after all these years! ok computer on a burned cd! hurrah! i had to wait so long. in earnest how can anybody really enjoy a record like this? these ever meandering songs that sometimes start auspicious or have some decent middle part before or after mostly presenting some nerve-wrecking noise? this whining singer whose voice is even more bugging than bonos? where do these lads have their ideas from? is it u2s misled achtung baby? is it some unknown troubled psychedelic trip jazz prog combo from finland or so? i do not know and to be honest it does not interest me at all. maybe in the end radiohead are some paranoid androids? ha! ha! ha! ps there is one track that somehow appeals to me throughout its very length. it is called lucky. and another one almost manages the same achievement. it is called exit music for a film. nevertheless even these songs probably would not make it on one of my mix cds for the car stereo.,0
so let me get this straight. a bunch of one-hit-wonder grunge copyists pablo honey bottom out after flitting over to overly-precious britpop the bends and then decide that song structure is what is holding them back. the melodies and words on ok computer sound like thom yorke is making them up as he sings them. the thematic conceit is retarded. the music - while not wholly unlikeable - trades bombast for pretension. and some people find this challenging and out-there? it is avant-garde for people who have never heard anything avant-garde - much closer to the meandering tuneless self-important prog bullshit that made punk rock necessary. unfortunately - though predictably - this psuedo-intellectual gussied-up britpop approach to experimentalism proved safe enough that ok computer tapped into the zeitgeist. in other words it is just out there enough to give a conservative mainstream audience a fleeting sense of being hip. now get back in your cages.,0
i can sort of understand the praise this album gets. the execution is really pretty good and if you are buying what they are selling i can see the attraction i am not however buying. i had not intended ever owning this as every radiohead song i would heard has left me cold but after a lengthy discussion with a friend who could not understand how anyone could not like this he gave me a copy assuring me that i would come around. i tried i really did but i just cannot enjoy this at all. the biggest sticking point is probably the annoyingly whiny i am just so fucking profound vocals but not far behind is all the clich studio gimmickry the weak songwriting and uninteresting arrangements. the band does play well from a technical standpoint but that stopped being enough for me when i was about 14.,0
i can see a few progressive rock elements in this record at least it surely has a very elaborated psychedelic  alternative rock style. the grunge electric guitars may remind you the king crimson of the mid 70s. the psychedelic dimension may remind you pink floyd and porcupine tree. there are 2 elements that i really do not like 1 the electric guitars arrangements that have a gross garage sound. 2 yorkes plaintive and irritating voice that expresses all the pain  misery one can feel during his early life. the melody and harmony are not too much present on most of the tracks! thom yorke sings a bit like bono of u2. is the way he sings a manifestation of all the pain he has lived? the tracks are serious and depressing maybe this record allows the deletion of internal uneases this record does not have this effect on me. the main problem is the lack of catchiness and addiction. plus one has to admit that the tracks sound pretty marginal. the worst moments are definitely tracks like fitter happier and electioneering. electioneering is a real teeth grinding track. there are some decent moments subterranean homesick alien has not bad keyboards arrangements  echoed ambience. the good futuristic end of let down is unfortunately too short. the more melodic track no surprise actually has a surprise some good percussions which may make you forget the annoying rhythmic guitar! the tourist and let down have catchier refrains. if i compare to the usual alternative rock bands then ok computer is more interesting and sophisticated. on the other hand i do not feel the need to keep this record in my collection. 2 stars seems appropriate. please live and let live do not tell people what to like or to not like there is a reason that explains why people like radiohead and the important is that it is good for them.,0
so yeah i decided highest rated on the site? got to be worth a listen. and i will admit i kind of wanted to come out all self-righteous and dismissive of this so-called masterpiece. but you know what? credit where it is due this is not half bad probably more so if you are a particular fan of accessible art rock. it gets particular points for exit music as a genuinely absorbing and emotional dirge. however also being honest much of the rest feels fairly disposable. is it the best album ever? no not by a long shot. but it is not worth hating either.,0
i do not get why this is number 1... the best thing i can say about it is that it is at least not annoying. why do so many people like music like this? it has no energy no heart. it sounds like the kind of music you would use in a movie because nobody notices it. paranoid android is the best song but i should rather say it is the only one i can bear. i do not hate radiohead i just do not see what i should like about their music. for me this album is a bunch of very tedious songs that do not deliver anything memorable except some horrible moanig vocals.,0
for whatever reason earlier on i was sat about reading this albums wikipedia page and i thought you know i really need to listen to this. this is essential music. there are radiohead albums out there you have never heard and instead you are listening to aryan kampf 88! wikipedia sure makes a big fuss about some guys who made a record. makes the songwriting process sound like some sort of world-changing historical event. the amount of praise vomited upon this album had me prepared to believe the hype. as i put my headphones on i looked around the room and was half-thinking that when this thing was over my life would not be the same again. after my head was cleared of bombastic thoughts i pushed play and submitted to 53 minutes of radiohead. and lo it sounded... alright. this is nowhere near as epic as i thought it would be. i mean airbag is a pretty damn epic way to open an album. but the majority of the remaining tracks just seem a little too pedestrian for my liking when i was expecting something experimental. here is the part where i get contrarian most of this is just poprock. do you hear me? i said most of this is poprock!!! and i am not trying to be an arsehole. let down kind of reminded me of that song by take that about riding on a star and ruling the world just a little bit more fancy with some electro-bleeps here and there. i just think that above all thom yorkes mumbling style is not really too my liking i do not find he has enough presence. songs like exit music passed by unnoticed. electioneering was a much-needed harder track but is let down by a completely anticlimactic chorus. i will not deny that the whole thing has a good atmosphere particularly subterranean homesick alien and paranoid android especially the god loves his children part. no surprises is probably the highlight in terms of guitar playing. call me a bullshitter but while most people say that fitter happier is the albums weakest moment i thought it was one of the strongest tracks. it is just so eerie this cold mechanical text-to-speech voice recycling cliches of the advertising industry over sparse electronica. it seems a more interesting indictment of consumer culture than what we get in the other songs. if thom yorke devised this piece when he had writers block maybe writers block gives him better ideas. do you want to hear a great album? listen to tenacious ds complete discography instead!! belch,0
rymfail fuckradiohead fuckapple fuckobamney fucknpr fuckikea fuckreligion fuckpolitesociety fuckarenarock about 7 years ago my friend john lent me his badly scratched up copy of this cd from his messy bedroom full of badly scratched cds and instruments and sculptural objects because i had never heard it before and it was so famous. he was the drummer in make a rising and a trusted music head and the equally trustable jesse was there too saying yeah man this is like a 90s prog masterpiece so i said okay okay i will finally listen to this band. actually i had heard radiohead once before in the 90s. i was driving down to a college in maryland to hear noam chomsky give a talk and one of my close high school friends was driving and he was talking about this band that was so radical or subversive or righteous or something like that and he played some of their songs. i am pretty sure that was before this album came out. i remember thinking the music was pretty boring and that friend was a little mainstream in his taste while i had already gone way into avant-garde music and seen evan parker paul lovens and all kinds of stuff live. my friend was still in some kind of mtv 90 minutes pseudo-alternative music zone so i did not take his opinion seriously. awesome guy though. hey i met noam chomsky that day. fuck radiohead. but actually that song creep was pretty cool. i think i heard it that day in my friends car. so back to this album called ok computer. so i borrowed the cd from john and played it in my car later that day. i could not make it through the whole album but i listened to maybe all but the last two tracks i think before i gave up and put on some real music. seriously if someone handed me an unlabelled cd and i did not know anything about this band i would listen to like two or three tracks and say okay it is a pretty nice mid 90s britpop spinoff very bland and uncreative sounds like a thousand other bands so it is not worth hearing any further. but in actuality i was listening to this roundabout 2005 and at that time radiohead was a massively famous band and this album was massively popular and widely acclaimed occasionally acclaimed by respectable music connoisseurs e.g. some of my favorite rymers not just ignorant teenagers. so given that context i felt compelled to listen to more than two or three tracks to hear what the fuss was about. well i never heard it. it was a pleasant poprock effort with some slightly above-average production. the fact is that i really do like this kind of music in general. i grew up with it. it is familiar and enjoyable. i have heard a million things that sound like this and it is just mainstream culture fluff in my opinion. anyway there is like two hundred bands in the 60s that made albums that blow this out of the water on every level. this album should not even be in the all-time top 1000 on rym but i am just making a boring rant. do not get me wrong i liked this album. it was a solid 3 star album with 3.5 potential but the whiny vocals took it down a notch. maybe someday i will try to listen to this album again and get all the way through. i do not really doubt the positive testimonials of so many people. oops i accidentally reached the end of this review without even mentioning axl rose one of my favorite singers. maybe i will re-write it sometime.,0
really the biggest problem i have with this is the same problem i have with other radiohead releases that this does not go for the jugular in trying to depress move or thrill me. it just is. it is like it is not trying hard enough. and that sort of listless feeling is one i get from a lot of alt-rock that came after this album. i cannot pretend i like what this influenced all that well either - but there is no denying that you can basically hear every trace of every modern rock band in this thing and that is pretty cool. the guitars in particular actually stand out despite the fact that every band of this ilk since has unsuccessfully probably tried to ape them. a common complaint about radiohead seems to be pretentious and i do not feel that at all here. this feels like very honest music - like the band actually wanted to be responsible for what they were creating. i like that even if the intent sometimes fumbling anti-establishment messages or grey slow down luddite stuff is not exactly what i prefer. and you know what - even today we often need to be reminded of our place among machines and their place among us. mostly however this is just some cool often inventive and diverse rock. and that is what matters to be perfectly frank.,0
si he de ser totalmente sincero no recuerdo haber escuchado sobre radiohead en los 90s quiz sea por que en sa poca yo estaba ms interesado en otro tipo de msica adems que pocos discos cds o cassettes creo que todava existan para 1997 y obviamente los que compraba no iban a ser de un tipo de msica del que no estaba interesado tampoco escuchaba mucha radio aunque en realidad en toda mi vida son pocas horas las que le he dedicado a la radio por lo que ciertamente no recuerdo muy bien mi historia con radiohead en los 90s. la cosa no cambi mucho pocos aos despus cuando se puso de moda la descargas de discos con napster y esas cosas la piratera de cds tambin estaba en apogeo sin embargo all tampoco recuerdo que me haya interesado en sta banda fue varios aos despus ms o menos a mediados de los 00s casi una dcada despus cuando recuerdo haber escuchado atentamente algo de stos ingleses para esa poca ya haban publicado otros tres discos por cierto todos muy bien recibidos aunque obviamente unos ms que otros. como lo poco que haba escuchado no me haba gustado decid organizarme ya que hasta ese momento tena canciones sueltas de distintos discos y fuen entonces cuando pens que lo mejor era escuhar un slo disco para entender el concepto de la banda y encontrarle ese gusto que muchos parecen encontrarle y yo no entonces surgi una pregunta obvia por dems con cual disco empezar? pues ya que hasta ese momento la banda haba publicado 6 discos pens que lo mejor sera empezar por el mejor y fue asi como me hice de ste ok computer. cuando lo escuch simplemente no me gust pero viendo las maravillas que muchos hablan sobre sta banda pens que quiz si escuchaba sus dos discos anteriores poda entender su evolucin se no fue el caso escuchaba ok computer y segua sin gustarme escuch ste disco varias veces durante varios meses lo escuchaba a distintas horas del da con distintos estados de nimo en distintas situaciones y nunca me pareci que fuera tan bueno como muchos decan. finalmente recuerdo que durante algn tiempo lo escuchaba en las noches y lo encontr como un excelente somnfero la verdad es que estando despierto es un disco algo cansino y aburrido pero dentro de todo en definitiva no es para nada un mal disco pero tampoco es una maravilla ya luego de varios aos tratando de disfrutarlo en definitiva slo puedo tolerarlo y disfrutar como tal slo algunas pocas canciones.,0
the most overrated music album of all time but it is still ok. sorry for the fans but ok computer and wish you were here from pink floyd do not play in the same league... fav tracks  karma police no surprises lucky.,0
the album cover should be put on a flag for the town that has the highest concentration of hipsters. ok computer is the culmination of unethical music journalism and impressionable hipsters coming together for the sheer purpose of giving an otherwise sub-par album god-like status. most the songs on ok computer are composed like movie backdrops. alot of radioheads fan base probably would not admit this because it makes the anti-song structures on display sound less astounding. well that is exactly the case here. bands like pink floyd and yes were also known for utilizing song structures that deviated from the basic pop formula. but yknow what separates these two bands from radiohead? talent. pink floyd and yes had enough of it to actually make their experiments a success. radiohead on the other hand only need a few music publications to vouch on their behalf and inform the music listening public that their boring and messy experiments are actually groundbreaking works of genius.,0
tyle w tym energii e mona puci na wita zamiast kold lol.,0
for some reason i always go into this album thinking i will have my mind blown. for some reason that never happens. it is a good album but that is about the extent of it. edit i find some songs to be very good like paranoid android and let down but then there are others such as airbag electioneering no surprises and lucky that do very little for me.,0
really a 2 star album so i am trying to get the average where it belongs. i have tried to listen to this 5 times since i heard it was so great and stuff. usually i get irritated or bored and stop it half way through. there is one good song i cannot remember what its called. the sound effects and talking robots are dated and were a bad idea to begin with. this band has talent and even has some sorta vision but are just going through the motions here. creep is an excellent song but that was on another cd.,0
before you knock this off as another get out of the top spot review allow me to explain why i feel this album is average to fairly good at best. i bought ok computer earlier this year with no real radiohead experience other than karma police creep paranoid android and exit music for a film. pretty much the bare bones of what your average person may think of when asked about radiohead. i felt let down pun not intended by the album after hearing such praise given to it from virtually every institution that would care to review it and i believe that this initial listen started off my relationship with this album on a bad note. my first review of this album consisted of a three star rating and a complaint about a mediocre album being in the top spot on this site. my first listen went a little like airbag only memorable as the opening track paranoid android song exit music karma police more use of the paranoid android voice a strong upbeat track no surprises song and last song. the only part of this album that i really enjoyed besides the hits was electioneering which i thought was interesting because it was the only track that was straightforward rock. so over the next few months i would play bits from the album and occasionally the entire album growing more accustomed to it. i came to a point where i could see why people praised the album so frequently but i still did not get why it was at the top of so many best ever lists. i also checked out more radiohead material finding this less accessible than the bends and more accessible than kid a and their other early-2000s releases. and definitely more impressive than what i had heard from the king of limbs. then something interesting happened. as i grew more and more accustomed to ok computer and radiohead in general this album flipped itself on its head. i realized that i was listening to the tracks that i had passed off as filler more and listening to the tracks i was originally attracted to less. despite having only known karma police paranoid android and exit music for little more than a year they suddenly feel as if i have heard them thousands of times. i am tired of them as well as the increasingly bland subterranean homesick alien and no surprises. when i first heard paranoid android i saw a comment on its video hailing it as the bohemian rhapsody of the 90s. it was never that and now it feels more and more like a song made of the hurried fusion of multiple other songs. it is not smooth in transitioning at all. keep in mind that this was not a song that i fell in love with and listened to hundreds of times a day. i would only listen to it every so often. but enough about the hits. everybody has already said everything that needs to be said about those a thousand times over. this review is one of more than 1600 on this site alone after all. one day recently i played airbag for lack of anything else that i wanted to hear. i like to associate colors on album covers with the songs does anyone else do this? on the album and whereas white is a symbol of boredom with subterranean homesick alien it suddenly became a symbol for a breath of fresh air on airbag. had this song always sounded this good? let down has a shimmering guitar sound and the second best chorus on the album only topped by the sensational i am born again on airbag. this song is really where the intricate layering of the album comes into play. electioneering has always been a nice track but only recently has climbing up the walls turned from filler at least in my eyes to manic energy. lucky may just be may just be my favorite track on the album. it has such a great pulsing sound and seems less trebly and more full sound-wise a sound that would make so many tracks on this album even better. the tourist is not really an ideal track and i see it as radioheads answer to the stooges l.a. blues or death trip. set over deep atmospherics it has a wild aspect to it. even though there are lyrics it feels like yorke is just flowing with the music. for most of the tracks here this album has very little replay value. paranoid android may have been amazing and wholly awesome the first few plays but eventually it is time to move on to more interesting things. as i mentioned before i like to associate the main color of the album cover with the sounds it contains within. and it fits quite well here unfortunately ok computer has an alienating feel to it. as a guitar player i have never been big on turning the treble up. i prefer a warmer sound and that is how i feel about this album. it is much too trebly and sounds hollow the prime offenders here are exit music for a film and subterranean homesick alien. cover everything you want to in reverb but that does not mean that it will have full sound. the deep reverb worked wonderfully on airbag but the band should have realized that not everything will work the same way. if ever an album has suffered from a distinct lack of bass it would be this album. even on metallicas ...and justice for all which has been criticized for having jason newsteds bass almost nonexistent in the mix the sound is deeper than what is presented on ok computer and that is a big issue for me as a listener. i only just bought in rainbows today without hearing anything but 15 step and videotape and it is quite clear that radiohead understood their sound issue on this album. in rainbows has such a full warm sound that makes most of ok computer tremble in comparison. it does not mean that the alienating sound of this album should be removed but the full feel of songs like lucky should be explored on more tracks throughout the album. possibly the biggest factor that stops this album from being the greatest of all time in my book is that none of the songs connect with the listener on a personal level. radiohead were definitely up in the clouds during the making of ok computer as it is not an earthly or humanly album at all. maybe that is the point -- i have heard plenty of talk about this being based conceptually around technology but it could have been so much more. there is no connection between the listener and the band which is what makes a great album a great album. you can hear pain in tonights the night and nebraska. you can hear the humanity in bitches brew come from a group of musicians playing together for the first time. even in the classic pink floyd records you do not have to connect fully with the ideas of the mind breaking down or orwellian society but records like dark side of the moon and animals are submersive. the listener can imagine that heshe can connect with them. radioheads ok computer however is not as submersive nor is it something i can connect with. yorkes lyrics are praised for their ambiguity but they are not interesting. think of some of the best lyricists of all time none would make their songs so full of phrases and lines that do not go anywhere. and at times yorkes falsetto is difficult to understand. i can see that radiohead were trying to be as different as possible but i feel that it just did not work out as they had hoped. overall ok computer is a collection of both good and bad tracks. which tracks are which are entirely up to you and sometimes they might even surprise you as they did me. but the good tracks while awesome still seem shallow and alienating. it is not really the tracks themselves but the atmosphere and hollowness of the album that makes it a two star album. it is certainly not the best album out there and hopefully i have been able to lay out a compelling case for such a point of view.,0
i was and still am an admirer of radiohead. i would never subscribe to the notion of them being groundbreaking or particularly innovative but they have released some records that have pricked my ears up. i was so eager to hear their new record after loving the bends that i took the day off work yes i am that old and queued up for this record on the day of it is release. 14 years later and i am still reeling from the bitter disappointment that i felt on that day. radiohead became tainted in my eyes and although the good will i have towards the band resurfaced upon subsequent releases it was never the same. this record is the one that i avoid. that day 14 years ago was the only time this record has had an emotional impact on me. whenever i hear it i feel nothing whatsoever. perhaps that is the point but personally i listen to music because i want to perhaps be enlightened to some degree and to this end gain some satisfaction maybe feel a certain way be it happy or sad desolate devastated angry or whatever variations of those states that you can come up with. something at least. i do not find the records message and themes particularly enlightening original engaging or engrossing either. every generation has it is own thing it is own struggles the monotony and utter meaninglessness of what and who we are and what we do the absolute terror that our existence is when you pause and think about it for a minute. it is nothing new. records like this have been released for years previous to this one. the production values here are poor and samey and i believe that sonically it has dated very badly much more so than the bends...and this record holds some of my least favourite radiohead songs... electioneering for example. seriously? it sounds just like the stereophonics. paranoid android is a great name for a song despite it is hitchhikers guide to the galaxy references which litter the record in fact but it is dull and lifeless and feels forced i can even hear the joins between movements which serves to cement my opinion that the record is badly produced. the only 2 tracks i like on here are let down and fitter happier. the bends kid a amnesiac hail to the thief in rainbows and king of limbs are much better records than this. easily the most over rated release in the history of popular music. classic records transcend their era become timeless. ok computer does not accomplish this whatseover it is very much of it is time and very averagely so. it is better than pablo honey though.,0
absurdooooooooooooo!!!! es inexplicable como estos seores imitadores de sonidos facilistas y depresivos sean el lbum nmero uno de la historia - segn esta lista claro est. evoco una frase de karl marx el comn denominador de las opiniones colectivas es la mediocridad. yo no tengo nada personal en contra de esta banda pero recuerdo mtv cuando este lbum sali con su cancin caballito de combate con aquel video interminable y aburrido. en cuanto a lo musical poco que decir nada complejo nada elaborado la parte vocal es lisa aburrida mal cantada podra decir. un lbum que inaugura una generacin emo tivamente depresiva y mediocre. una vergenza para esta pgina y para sus votantes ojal esto cambie pronto. esta mierda no puede ser el mejor lbum de la historia de la msica esto me parece un insulto una broma. qu se le puede decir a otras bandas rock como the beatles queen o solistas como pavarotti caruso kraus o jazzistas de mximo nivel o artistas folk de finesa inigualable que son superados por radiohead?? pfff... no me iba a detener jams en mi vida a escribir sobre esto pero como melmano y crtico musical estaba en un deber ante la sociedad. perdn si ofendo a los fans pero ante todo libre pensamiento y justicia histrica. gracias y saludos.,0
le truc le plus surcot de toute lhistoire du rock. le seul passage  peu prs coutable est pomp sur sexy sadie de john lennon lequel le pauvre doit se retourner dans sa tombe en voyant que cette merde est aujourdhui classe avant revolver et abbey road !!! most overrated thing ever.,0
this is a great pop album. it took a few listens to enjoy this to its fullest. i think why it took so long for me to like the album the way i do now is because of the outrageous amount of unjustified praise it has. the album is great like i have already underlined but why oh why best album ever? radio head brings nothing...nothing new to poprockmusic with these songs. admit it.. its charm is found in the vocal instrument and timing simplicity and some cool atmospheric sounds. that said the vocals are not well sung. the lyrics are goofy and make no sense. so much effort went into being cute every single moment of every single song. its like being force fed a whole pint of honey in less than 30 seconds it is nice and sweet but toward the end your going to choke and vomit and just maybe never be able to enjoy honey again. pet shop boys are much better in all facets and they have been doing this much longer. i would recommend this album to anyone but 5 stars? never.,0
let us come peacefully to the fact that is neither completely devoid of value nor the cutting edge of the 90s.,0
and what will happen if i look you in the eye and told ya that i loved ya yeah well it is not the kind of thing that you think of when it all comes down to wires we are gurgling up into the ether now humming tourselves in crisp night air we are listening to radiohead yes radionhead theyyou are were a very popular band between about 1990 a.d. annie dawson?????????? and 2013 same before everything changed in a big stock market crash omg omg is this a creative writing review i hope not though they can be good it is just that is not what i am in the mood for right so agnes hi i am richard i come from connecticut where i sell trinkets in at a big yellow stand by twelfth street i listened to the radio head album once i was fifteen and very sick and pressed up against the window smiling i think i quite liked it it made me think of warm places i was sick you remember i remember the summer the clipped blue those little streets wotsit like to be sick you say well i say everything floating and then summer and the blue upbove and thinking i will never betray this this perfect moment ashy redblue in skies i could do it just now but this album betrays the moment yes i accuse it of treason to the moment what i look for in the very end is a kind of fidelity that holds an i love you delivered at 001 that clings til whenever it all comes crashing down over and this is what you could never do thom and everyone else you could give me no surprises you could give me those bits of airbag you could reach at something you could find something in those little moments but could yuou give me what they gave me and could you give that afternoon i first heard it when everything could have when she and i and when the and i was and it was and i am tired of it there is a kind of transcendence that maybe i will never have a need to feel a refined need for taking shelter in the with the i yes okay i will admit it you get me in bits and pieces but it is and she is and he is and they are and they are beckoning it is that golden sky we are the moment thom you are not giving it is a body without a soul or a soul without a body will i ever grow to see that it is all i grew alright but not in the way you expected every speech is ultimately about the speaker and every work of art ultimately says more about its audience than it is creator i nicked that sentiment from oscar wilde and you are saying nothing to me saying it well perhaps but i do not think that what you think is happening is happening but i do not have to agree but give me a true love i can feel what hi i am it is edit what the fuck?,0
the only good song is sexy sadie. radiohead  most overrated music act of all time. too bad there is no 0.0 that is what it is worth.,0
no est mal... pero de ninguna manera es el mejor disco de la historia de la msica... creo que su posicin est inflada por gente que nunca escuch cosas mejores por una cuestin generacional simplemente...,0
i really wish i could have listened to this album without the awerness of the whole hype that surrounds it. because of that i expected god knows what kind of uber-epiphany that will change my life forever. what i have got is an average alt rock record with extremely annoying vocals and pseudo-intellectual lyrics. music-wise it is basically the same stuff as on the bends with occasional trip hop beats in the background. and as on radioheads previous effort there are some decent songs with really pretty melodies and even interesting structure. however most of the tracks lose their momentum after a minute or so or are just plain bad electioneering. the only exception that i honestly like is the opening airbag. and just as before the thing that makes this album practically unlistenable for is thom yorkes unbearable voice. most of the time he sounds like a crying little boy deprived of his favourite teddy bear some time ago with occassional fits of hysteria when he remembers how much he loved that bear. also the lyrics criticizing the yuppie culture and dehumanization of man if i got that right are average at best. to sum up there is a hint of evolution in the introduction of elements of trip hop but apart from that the band copies their winning in terms of sales formula from the bends. the fact that this is the highest rated album on rym is astonishing. highlight  airbag lowlights - fitter happier we all know it is fun to play with the voice synthesizer but come on! - electioneering just a very poor song - climbing up the walls yorkes whining at its worst,0
have i finally crossed the point of no return? i have been interested should i put that? in radiohead for a number of months now. not to say i like the band just interested why everyone rates them so highly among those elite music circles. i have ever heard one person say radiohead is music. now that is some quote to live up to and with that i actually spend money and bought this record i am not sure totally why. anyway now for that review the album starts off with airbag and before i actually listened to this album fully i listened to this song countless times for me it sounded really good so it obviously urged me on to listen to the album as a whole and get my full opinion of it. there are a few other songs worth noting on this album which for me makes it listen-able even if i do not like the album has a whole. why does half the album quickly go sour half way through? i am all up for diversity but this is not as good as i would of thought. in summary i like this album but i feel the some songs do better separately than all together. do not get me wrong i actually like some of the stuff here just together it feels a little weaker. for a glimpse this album has proved one fact i want to listen to more. i am not sure on what as attracted me to this album just yet maybe the catchy arty moments it has i do not know yet anyway the band are on my radar now. i will have to listen to more radiohead to get an idea if i actually like them..,0
they said soundscape textured layered... i say boredom. the most overrated album in rock era listen the whole album at once could put you in a state that could take you weeks to get out. just paranoid get some light but quickly back to mediocrity like drforknspooner said in the previous review.,0
radiohead 1997 ok computer beats 3.0 good 512 exclude 7 interlude airbag karma police the tourist lucky electioneering radiohead rh is a rock band from abingdon uk consisting of lead singerguitarist thom yorke ty  instrumentalists whose instruments include guitar drums piano  electronic production. this is rhs 3rd studio album  1st that i have reviewed. vocals -0.5 ty is a mediocre singer with a decent voice yet mediocre unintelligible annunciation. i recommend skipping this  instead listening to pearl jam 1993 vs.,0
what this album really lacked is substance. yes substance. i found it to be dull and uninspiring. i am probably suppose to enjoy this because i listen to a lot of alternative and alternative-rock. there was maybe a moment or 2 during no surprises and lucky where i thought maybe there could be something to this album. i put headphones on for a little while to see if there was something beneath the prominent sounds. the result was very little to nothing. i tried enjoying this album.. really!,0
i had to listen to this all the time in my art class... after many plays i can say without a doubt that i find the material to be mediocre nothing more nothing less. the production is good there is a considerable amount of variation in terms of textures and oscillations and the like but nothing really strikes a chord with me. i am sure my senior year classmates in art would berate me for saying this but... honestly i think this is one of the most overrated bands ever. if you want more art rock i would suggest you listen to something like talking heads.,0
shit i was hoping to be the first person to review this album but someone got there before me. when i first heard this i thought radiohead were the most significant and interesting british rock band since the days of cream and soft machine but i was not sure that i actually liked them. my problems? i do not like the inexpressive singing - there are times when inexpressive singing can be effective lou reed for instance whose voice seems unable to hold any emotional content but that suites the deadpan horrors of his songs we are never sure whether he is being ironic or not - but here i just find it a long whinge and of course there is a certain tradition of english whingy singers. and i do not like the lyrics - this can be put down to a matter of taste but they are always too self-consciously clever too self-consciously weird too self-consciously arty a series of clever lines that do not add up to a song but a posture. so what did i like about them? they come up with some superb melodies which they then attack with electronic noise. listen to the first track although not one of their strongest melodies there is something there that is hummable but then over a fairly straight forward rhythm the electric guitars thunder into it assaulting the likeability of the song this happens time after time and creates a real tension in the music a sense of promise that is constantly frustrated. but then i got further doubts like a lot of ambitious rock the result is a certain bombast and they are not above clich listen to exit music the moment when the drums come in and the song seems to go up a gear that is just corny and the backing vocals which become a choir going aaaahhhh - this is like pouring syrup over the melody. underneath the electronic aggression they are a very sentimental band it is all a bit easy there is a certain lack of real imagination. listening to the album is like sitting next to a drunk in a bar one moment he is aggressively belligerent the next he is maudlinly sentimental at first there may be a certain excitement in this the threat of the unexpected of a danger but it quickly becomes a routine a bit obvious a bit dull. which leaves the question did rock run its course about 35 years ago did it run out of musical ideas since then just revisiting the same territory time after time?,0
...auch eine million fliegen machen aus scheie keine schokolade! da waren definitiv zu viele lustigmacher in den hirnen.,0
very overated i just do not understand why this album is rated so highly.....where are the tunes ??????? try whistling these so called songs......ha !,0
it goes without ever having to say again that radiohead and especially this album ok computer are often regarded as the greatest thing to close out the 90s alternative rock fuss. for some reason this bands sound has never thrilled me the way i always felt like it should have. every critic that has ever been privileged enough to have their pieces printed on paper have proclaimed ok computer along with nevermind mind you as the greatest record to be let loose on the rock world. additionally do not forget to bear in mind the tremendous following this group has accumulated since the release of this widely hailed album. i am not saying this to diminish radioheads talent and ambition by any means but i can honestly say that i have never been able to park myself in one position and listen to this so-called magnum opus without ever feeling the need to take a quick snooze.,0
thom yorke a wonderful voice wasted on boring music,0
so here it is. the great one. where should i begin? dissapointment? annoyance? unlistenable pop genius? yes that all applies i suppose. but it could just be the genre. in that case maybe radiohead is a good band but no i should not make excuses. i just cannot listen to them. no matter how hard i try no matter how many times i listen to them no matter how many i tell myself to put off this review because it is a great album i always come out empty. combine this with a bad experience that was capped off with two of dumbest literally people i have met losing themselves in the art that is exit music for a film and i am left with left a sour taste that even warheads cannot create. even karma police the golden gem that anchors it all has almost become a cliche. i like the song but only as a change pace tune on a mix cd. put side to side with other radiohead songs and you lose all appreciation for it. it is odd but every radiohead song that i like still annoys me and it is that annoyance that prevents me from becoming a radioheadhead.,0
i really tried to like this but tell me what the hell makes this a classic? to my humble taste it is so horribly boring and uninteresting. there is nothing in it no passion no love no energy.,0
i would long avoided listening to this album probably due to my own skepticism on how ridiculously highly rated and lauded this album and band is. i would heard karma police before which was pleasant enough and now finally i come to reviewing ok computer which in all honesty did not place me in the other dimensions most other raters seem to experience upon listening to this. the most obvious feature of ok computer and radiohead in general i suppose is the whiney-drawl-moan of thom yorke which does very little for me. it fits the haunting atmospheric nature of the music sure but to me it comes across somewhat grating. then we come to the consistency of the album which measured on it is own is excellent and keeps the listener well within the melancholic whimsy of each consecutive track. there are a few good tracks and most of the others are above-average britindiepop fare. i will definitely give this a few more listens but it is hard to believe that i will be moved any closer to the gushing-radiohead-love camp. as for it being rated one of the best albums of all time.. this is hardly a masterpiece and at best seems a consistent effort from a very highly acclaimed group.,0
bloody hell -- over 5000 people have given this a five star rating! o i listened to ok computer the whole way through and can i remember anything about it? i was not on any substances i had no distractions it just disappeared into the ether somewhere.,0

i really do not know why people adore this.ok there are lots of fans of this bandtherefore radiohead cannot be a bad bandnot a really good one for me though.ok the instrumental stuff is goodfor someit is too sleepy for me but what makes this band average is their vocal.i cannot stand his annoying voice.its makes the whole album insensiblelazysleepy.this band is overrated for me.i would give it less than 2.5 if there were not a lot of fans of this band.,0
i hate to throw around the over-rated tag but this album is definitely a contender for the dubious title of most over-rated album of all time. frankly it is mostly forgettable and unremarkable. occasional moments of genuine musical creativity shine through but as i said they are occasional there is a fine line between being really artistically creative and sticking a fork up your arse twisting ten times and claiming it is artsy and radiohead are familiar with crossing that line. also thom yorkes vocals are as dreadful as three cats being strangled. this is especially true for the slower songs which he completely massacres. now i will not lie. electioneering is a good song and karma police and paranoid android both have a few things going for them. the rest should be consigned to the rubbish bin of history. it seems some pseudo-elitists act all superiorist about radiohead and praise ok computer like it is the first and second comings of jesus combined it is hilarious really especially given all the amazing music out there that would be more deserving of such overly effusive praise. ah well what can you do?,0
it is the most overrated album ever. i noticed some interesting ideas a few nice melodies but these guys cannot play or sing the guitarists are not even professionals! i never understood and probably never will understand why this band and this record is interesting for so many people! i have tried to listen to the tracks - more than once and it just does not sound good it is simply boring and not even original!,0
shit album. wished my girl did not like that crap so much. one of the bands not allowed to be played home when i am around. this guy should be gagged once and for all,0
i do not know maby it is me but this album did nothing for me. maby i didnt have my head-phones on tight enough? it seems to lack power and drive so i guess if any music lover out there wishes to explore this band just beware there is a lack of umph you will not be snaping to a beat sence there really isnt one. i found it a bit.....over rated. but hey i also dislike opera.,0
ok computer gave new meaning to the term hype. as soon as it was released every publication hailed it as a masterpiece. inevitably the buying public soon followed. what is perplexing is that there are not much difference between this and the previous the bends. it is the same radio-friendly alternative ballads just more intricately arranged the same passionate stadium-rock overtones the same hypocritical message radiohead former middle-class students and current rock stars criticizing modern society. ok computer features two great songs the disjointed airbag and the hysteric prog paranoid android as well as a few interesting moments the psych lounge subterranean homesick alien the melodramatic buzz of let down the semi trip-hop climbing up the walls. on the other hand exit music karma police no surprises lucky with female backing vocals reminiscent of mid 70s floyd and tourist are soap operas dramas for white collar workers blockbusters for thinking people. at least half of this album is songs we have heard millions of times before and occasionally too reminiscent of rem. radiohead are the alternative-rock equivalent of steven spielberg. they produce thoughful albums sometimes with faux experimental overtones but when it comes down to it they are sentimental trite. ok computer is soft-rock disguised as art-rock it is the dark side of the moon of the 90s.,0
some say it is the greatest ever and i have tried very hard to like it but it just sounds mostly like twaddle to my cloth? ears,0
this album is alright. radiohead is a decent band but i fail to see why they are considered so great. ok computer is not even close to being a great album.,0
what other album inspires so many unsubstantiated pointless reviews such as simply the best album of the 90s full stop or induces as many pretentious diatribes equating this album to the very essence of human existence? one typically eloquent non rym internet review cites ok computer creates a replication of my whole existence and fools my worries into thinking they are the real thing as they leave me for a faade. instead of spending months picking the bones out of the above why not find any number of the countless similar reviews whereby the listener has found exactly what the meaning of life is via this albumthere are literally 1000s to be found by simply typing the words prententious radiohead reviews into google !!! the funny thing about the reviews is that the writers have often simply ignored what the band has to say about the creative impetus behind the tracks. a couple of slides across a mouse mat will find numerous sites whereby direct quotes from the band explain the lyrics. for instance airbag is simply about the joy of avoiding a car crash and the resultant adrenaline rush karma police is simply about wishing ill fate on your ex-boss and the bob dylan rip off subterranean homesick alien is simply about an essay that thom yorke was asked to write at schoolthis is all in the bands words who simply refused to offer any such overt pretentions and makes you wonder whether they have any rib cages left after they have finished their daily laughing spree about some of the meanings that those who are that way inclined impart upon this album. perhaps such pretentious meaning of existence interpretations come from the fact that in this album radiohead leave behind the guitar rock dominance of pablo honey and the bends and experiment superbly with everything they can get their hands on. weird keyboards multi segmentations computerised samplings electronica and amazing time shifts are all wrapped up in their undoubted technical brilliance as true exponents of their craft. they find amazing ways to talk about the normal emotions in life which could and are in the wrong hands be interpreted incorrectly. personally i admire the albumbut i admire it for what it actually is not for what it is is not. perhaps this is my fault in life. to me an airbag is an airbag a tosser of an ex boss is a tosser of an ex boss etc. fortunately it appears the band think the same way. unfortunately thousands of internet reviewers do not.,0
this is not a good album competeent yes but not good it is as pretentious as a band formed in oxford are likely to be and the feelings are simply not there.you soon get bored of the moany almost emo style of the lyrics.,0
i have never thought to myself boy radiohead has great guitar playing or drumming or thee like. instrumentally this album appears vastly inferior to so many great innovative albums of thee 90s decade. but still there is something like a mystique surrounding thee songs themselves how totally poweful thee lyrics are n how 10 years later karma police still sounds interesting in comparison to whatever else thee radio has played in those 120 months. thee huge crash cymbal hits that are predictable may get old thee guitars may sound like nothing special. but yorke has written some of thee great alt rock songs ever. i have loved this album particularly thee stretch from 2-5 n i have played it more consistently than almost any alt-rock album i have ever owned even with thee utterly whack album opener n tracks 7 n 8. thee rests just that enjoyable but i have yet to worship it n do not imagine i ever will. there is just so much more to thee 90s.,0
radiohead is really the band i have given the most chances to. i have never been able to listen to these guys any album and i came back to them because really i thought i was missing out on something seeing how acclaimed they are all over the world and even here at rym. i cannot say i have had any success and this record remains a bland one. would you guys rent me a set of ears for a weekend so that i could actually for once understand what you guys can hear that i cannot? ok this is not a bad record and it is listenable but... what else is there? the guys vocal is annoying as hell and the music is.... blah... lyrics may be the only thing that deserves attention but that is it. anyway.,0
if you need to say the expression overrated in a funny way you can always pronounce it ok computer. edit no surprises and let down are honestly quite good songs. this does not change the opinion that ok computer is the worst radiohead album this side of hail to the thief.,0
i think this group is the most overated group of musicians ever... sure i love some of the songs here but this is just not an album that i can listen to but once in a blue moon.,0
paranoid android karma police beautiful songs but that is about it. the remaining 10 tracks are overall nice but also quite boring. the fact is the music sounds like a compromise it is not as brit-pop as the bends and it is not as electronic as kid a and amnesiac. the result is a transition album uncertain about its nature and unwilling to exit its comfort zone. definitely not a standout in radioheads discography.,0
this is one of those albums i bought simply on the acclaim factor without really liking the band. i mean 55 million people cannot be wrong right? just goes to show how individual music taste is. i imagine fans of this album also love jeff buckleys grace and are into the flaming lips yoshimi at least 12 will also like coldplay. i have tried many times to listen to this record all the way through and i cannot manage it. it bugs me that much. weird hey.,0
why the hype? i freakin hate hype and the hype surrounding this album is totally unjustified. got rid of this album in disgust as a result...nowhere near as good as i was expecting. perhaps it is because i am not a spotty pretentious ignorant self-absorbed musically blinkered twit...i do not know. seems you have to believe the worlds against you and everything you want to love and believe in to really get this droning screachy drivel. it would be interesting to find out the average age of moron who own and deify this album....between 16  24 i would think and most of them bearing the scars of pubescent uncertainty and angst....says it all. apart from a few moments of quality it is mostly shite.,0
this is pathetic. as all radiohead albums have showed they are a bunch of talentless arogant hippocrits. drivel is the best word to some up this ridiculously over-rated album. it is truly lame. how can anybody call this music??!!! no rhythm no meaningful words which you cannot actually hear and no joy. pathetic. avoid like the plague if you no what real music is about.,0
crap. seriously total crap. if this is the best that mainstream music has to offer i want no part of it. i would rather listen to whale sounds on one of those get to sleep faster cds. this album is so boring that i want to gouge out my eyes with a spoon while listening to it.,0
this kind of music is so depressing that if you want to live happy life do not listen to this.,0
if this is a classic album what are crap ones like ? i bought this silly me based mainly on reviews i had read. ok i only paid 5.99 for it but that is still 5.99 too much. will someone explain to me why this is so highly rated because it sounds like a very boring run-of-the-mill album. i played it 3 times and got so utterly bored with it i just binned it so i would not be tempted to give it another try. if you are curious and are thinking about buying this cd do not. it is crap fact.,0
despite all of the masturbatory praise bestowed on it by seemingly every living member of the british rock press ... i really do not get this album. the tedious meandering arrangements yorkes reedy whine the self-satisfied gloomy progginess of the whole thing. honestly it is the auditory equivalent of a rain-soaked weekend.,0
is not this the album the us government used to smoke out manuel noriega? trying to get through the entire thing was pure torture. radiohead is creative alright-creatively bad that is! dull and listless drivel. undoubtedly this album is still used today to torment political dissidents all over the world. i stole the last line from a colleague of mine and i feel really bad about that - but not bad enough not to use it.,0
it is good but a masterpiece is a little much nothing more than a good album would not recommend it.,0
this album is evil. it is responsible for the whining whinging responsibility shirking culture that has pervaded western youth for the last 10 years. radiohead are not pointed sensitive critics of the post-modern military industrial complex or the alienation caused by modern technology. they are pampered mummys boys from the mean ghetto streets of oxfordshire who realised early that some girls dig it when boys look moody and have based their career and music on that fact. it boils down to a simple equation- music-soulpretensionradiohead having said this i like their basslines. no complaint at all about the bass player. the purpose of the glorious genre we call rock music is not to articulate self-indulgent misery or indeed to save the whale. radiohead attempt to do both without even thinking up a tune. the idea if you are writing songs from the dark side is to articulate pain. genuine sincere pain. or if you are writing about politics blinding anger.this cannot be done when you are concerned about karma police infecting your brain. still less when your imagery is so elliptical you could be singing about literally nothing. it was once said of paul simon that if some girl had not have treated him so bad in high school we would have missed out on all those marvelous songs. thom oh how i hate that darn h seems to have had the same experience reading a un report on wealth redistribution. by all means listen to the first two albums the second especially  but do not buy into this nonsense. you will never get out.,0
over-indulgent pretentious wallowing pink floyd-esque crap. disappointing because the bends was so good. lucky is excepeted from above criticism.,0
not a masterpiece! that is a word that gets thrown around by people who do not listen to enough music. the word masterpiece should only apply to things that are flawless. ok computer is not. with only four good songs out of twelve it is easy to make a case for this being the most blown out of proportion album of all time. get over it. with a little searching you can find much better music to obssess about that is actually original.,0
the singer has an interesting voice and paranoid android is a pretty good song . other than that they are boring and you could never party listening to them . this is music for anti-social behavior just as the band exudes . the biggest reason for reviewing this album is all you radiohead fans bash all the really good music from the 70s . if ya like radiohead it should be a key to stay away from music that rocks !,0
i looked in a dictionary to look up the definition of overrated. it said to overestimate the merits of rate too highly. i did not like that definition so i printed out the album art from this album and pasted it over the definition. at least i have something good to look at now instead of those crappy pictures they have in the dictionary. okay its not that bad airbag karma police and electioneering are highlights here but the album for the most part seems very top-heavy starting off really strong and just goes downhill after fitter happier. is this a decent album? absolutely! is this the go-to album in terms of art rock and arguably music overall? absolutely not! that would come with their next release...,0
beggars my brain how this album can possibly be voted the best album of all time. apart from one or two interesting moments paranoid android specifically - even if it is a bowie rip-off this is dull insipid lifeless dirge. typical modern droning vocals over a backdrop of art student instrumentation that tries to be very clever but comes off as hopelessly contrived. this has got to be one of the most over-rated bands of all time. but then why am i surprised? i look at the charts and see acts like take that lily allen and tinie tempah as icons. radiohead come from the same mtv generation that spawned those acts - and therein lys the problem - the people who voted for this are obviously too young and cultureless to know about what is gone before. anyone under the age of at least 40 simply should not be allowed to vote on music unless they have educated and immersed themselves in the abundance of riches from years gone by - not just the beatles. compare this album to something like bowies the man who sold the world where much of this was stolen from anyway and the gulf in class is so wide its laughable. no wonder the western worlds going down the pan.,0
this album would be the 3 best album of all time?? you must be either kidding or stone deaf! let me be clear i do not hate this music just because it is popular. no i hate it because it is a bleak monotonous depressive boring cold dull and atonal pile of cacophony. the extremely annoyingly out of tune vocals and dissonant random guitar solos sound like a worst of x-factor compilation. and the generic song structures and musicianship are plain insulting to my ears. and do not even dare tag this as progressive. this must be the new emperors new clothes story. wtf is wrong with you all?,0
another album praised by illiterate hipsters who follow rolling stone magazine and pitchfork as if they are the word of god. pretentious overtly banal and completely derivative of electronic sounds ok computer is a soulless enterprise that lingers off of false sincerity. this album does not mark the end of the album and the beginning of mp3-age as so many critics argue. it is just marks another point where rock criticism deviates from professionalism and into some mass marketing campaign. sorry folks. this is far from being considered a masterpiece. 25,0
radiohead are possibly the most inexplicably overrated music acts of all time and this one of the most ludicrously overhyped pieces of drearyturgid cack since i do not know when. the fact it regularly tops greatest ever album polls is proof positive that the world has gone mad. whiny introspecive shit that is not as clever or as original as the blinded fools who rate this so highly think. an absolute turd.,0
wow. i just got back to listening to the entire thing and now i feel suicidal...well anyway on with the review well ok lest start with the vocals...sounds like bob dylan getting raped by a whalewhich explains all the ocean noises...ok now let us see...ohh ya the guitar well there is no chord progression what so ever just playing that weird ass ocean noise over and again ooh ya and the solos are not solos there the the same fret being played at 200 bpms and well bass ooh ya they fired that guy for the whale mating call guy and the drums as boring and repetitive as everything else. so it makes me question why is this called art rock when all i see is a steaming pile of shit. at best this is a huge fail of a dark side of the moon tribute album in other words this is just about the same level of someone pooping in your ear as you watch your puppy die now if you excuse me i am going to go castrate myself to offset my mind from being ear raped,0
ok overhyped? ok groupthink? ok mass hallucination? ok emperors new clothes? look i appreciate music of any style. i want to like radiohead. i want to like everything. this. its not good. it is drivel. its tolerable at best unbearable at worst. the mix is a morass of thick headache inducing midrange unlistenable over long listening periods. the vocals are a largely unintelligible screech treading the line between whining and screaming. the songs are unergetic and uninspiring. its difficult to listen to at times. there are passages and songs that you want to skip. basically its like any other post-the bends radiohead album. none of these aspects define good music of any style. where are the memorable meloides hooks resonance dynamics the infectious songs that you want to hear on repeat for 2 hours?? not on this album. paranoid android and homesick alien are the only songs that do anything for me. the acoustic only version of alien is better. radiohead has always struck be as something british which americans say they like to pretend they are hip. the idea that this is one of the top 3 albums of all time defies commentary. its not even one of the top 3 radiohead albums which is not saying much anyway.,0
i have always liked radiohead i never really loved them or thought of them has one of the greatest bands ever but i liked what i heard this album is no different. its a great record. number 3 all time? i am not so sure but it is pretty damn good.,0
this is the most highly-rated album in this site. most of the users here treat this song like a next coming of christ. i cannot understand it. one of the greatest album. huh!. i cannot stand it. i do not really feel the hype of this album. how does this album is so overrated and pretentious? first be you hate me how does this song boring dull bland annoying and pretentious? how does this album became the one of the favorites of this site? i just misunderstood of this situation. when i see every ratings of this album most of them rated in 4 4.5 or 5 stars. that score is so marvelous. i am going to try to listen to because i thought it would be enjoyable. i thought that this album will be the 90s the dark side of the moon. just my expectation. however when i heard the songs such as paranoid android and karma police both the songs sounds dull and annoying. thom yorkes vocals sounds whiny especially the falsetto. he sounds like a tired person who wants to go to bed. as for their music the guitar solos of paranoid android sounds bland and sloppy as any of led zeppelin song. the song no surprises are so boring and pretentious that it is a cure for insomia. the rest of their tracks are just generic at best. their experimentations are so prententious and trying hard. conclusion hate me all you want but this album fails to impress me. i do not really feel the hype and i do not understand why this album got a lot of praises. i know we have our own opinions but we need to respect the opinions of each other. the review will be ends now.,0
i think it is just fine. it is a fine competent 90s rock album with an actual aesthetic to it - which immediately elevates it above almost every other alternative act that was busily shitting out culturally worthless singles and hits comps with reckless abandon around this same time. the overarching theme of urbanism and disaffection with modern society and the delayed future is not limited to lyrics alone - in fact quite provoking and confronting soundscapes and textures made of airplane noise freeway traffic distorted and rotten ads for long-discontinued junk food and junk film weave themselves through these verse-chorus-verse rock songs. it is an aesthetic i find pretty difficult to get used to - i do not feel civilized in cities. do you? i hate urban value systems. i got shot and died in the city once. i never went back again - which is probably why i do not like it more but it is still a meaningful concept that i can accept. airbag probably my favorite track off this album starts this off very strong - fuzzy guitar over an explosive cut-up drum beat with a cool end section that actually took me by surprise. paranoid android is a neat epic which does a fine job at covering some eclectic sounds going from dark flamenco to furious distorted guitar grunge and then to an admittedly boring synth-heavy end. subterranean homesick alien is more subdued toning the pace down to a crawl and hiding the guitars behind lethargic underwater synths and organs. exit music for a film is pretty neat - condensing explosions in the sky-style crescendocore and stolen footage from airports train stations future air strike targets etc into a four-minute campfire song. let down is another more subdued track - an urbanite spin on suburban emo that just about justifies its five-minute runtime. karma police is a pop song that decays into a wall of no signal tone and discarded scraps of jam sessions a conclusion that would be more rewarding if it had any actually interesting ideas before that. i do like how unexpectedly disgustful and full of contempt it is although exactly what that disgust or contempt is aimed at is unclear. a change in tradition perhaps? i sure hope so! fitter happier is a cool interlude - slogans read out by greyskins with authority - but the albums two biggest weaknesses - its static nature that prevents it from going anywhere and its sneering urban attitude - prevent it from doing a lot for me. electioneering plays like a parody of punk music - with vaguely political lyrics supposedly placing it as anti-establishment but something else about it placing it in reality as the complete opposite. climbing up the walls is more serious by comparison slurred unintelligible vocals over loud guitars heavy industrial-influenced drums noisy electronics and an atonal chorus of orchestral instruments trumpets? they sound jazzy. no surprises is the calm after the storm the light rain after a tornado. a sweet little song built around a xylophone and acoustic guitar. very cute. the final two tracks lucky and the tourist by comparison are kind of weak - demanding awe from the listener with their spacious free bird on 3rd plat guitar solos - but it all feels super cheap. it is like asking me to be impressed by some capeshit movie because scenes in it have lots of colors. get real. none of these songs are necessarily bad not at all. the fact i was inspired to write about them in the detail i have proves so. i just do not think they go anywhere. it is forward thinking guitar music which is respectable in of itself but i found most of the songs here just sort of start and stop. maybe it is the pop song structures maybe it is just me being an f-slur very likely but i was expecting something more from this. like there is just something holding it back that i cannot put my finger on. it is maybe one or two leagues beneath my own. barring all of that it is a fine album. chain linked fences and broken glass. the sprawl the city is haunted and nobody loves me. it means very little.,0
when i saw this album in the top 10 greatest albums on ryms charts i had high expectations for this album. oh boy was i disappointed. i wanted to like it but it was so painfully mediocre. most of the tracks are a 5 or 6 one is a 8 but i will get to that one soon enough. throughout most of the album the vocalist has such an unclear voice and you cannot make out any words. along with the instrumental performance being very repetitive and some themes on certain songs like fitter happier seem more like shitposts than anything. the only song that i would consider good is exit music for a film. the vocals are decently clear and there is a beauty to it. this was my first radiohead album and i am quite disappointed.,0
i know this will likely be a controversial review due to the albums legendary status so to make clear i do indeed like ok computer. the grating production of pablo honey and to a lesser extent the bends are gone replaced by a highly impressive futuristic pallet. before listening to the album for the first time i am currently listening through radioheads discography i was familiar with a handful of tracks... paranoid android exit music for a film karma police no surprises and i did like all of them. paranoid android specifically for a period of time when i was younger it was my favorite song of all time i never listened to anything else radiohead made lmao. and how was my first listen of ok computer? considering it has been praised as one of the greatest releases of all time i was underwhelmed. although i found a lot of the lyricism quite harrowing and even experimental the sound of the record still left an impression of a rehashing. this is by far the best radiohead record on my discography listen every album improves on the last but just in general the albums status is what very much leads the score to be lessened. ok computer still undoubtedly takes risks but the record not only flies by too fast to make an impact its sound does not offer much in comparison to other alternative albums of the time.,0
as i have been using this site for 3 years or so now i figured it was time for me to dive into ryms unopposed favorite band radiohead. i love in rainbows and kid a but both took some time for me to click so i gave this one what i think was a really fair shot. however it just never clicked with me in the way that the other two did. i just do not think this one is for me. that is not to say i do not enjoy it i am still going to give it a positive review but 1 album of all time? i do not think so not even close. the only songs here that really blow me away in the way that their other music has are subterranean homesick alien and exit music for a film. a lot of the others are just pretty good or only fine. maybe it is just because i am not into the more rock-y sounds of this album but even the harder songs from in rainbows like bodysnatchers and jigsaw falling into place are much better than anything here. maybe i just do not get it i do not know. strong 710,0
do not know how this trash is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. it contains some of the most boring uninspiring tripe you could ever think of. karma police has a nice and catchy melody and electioneering has a good guitar solo at the end but that is where the praise ends. do not even get me started on how boring thom yorkes vocals are. it just sounds like not even him wants to be there singing this boring crap. kid a and in rainbows are even worse though.,0
maybe i just do not like radioheads style. i sure love their genre. it is melodic alt-rock never too intense very clean and with occasional use of synths acoustic guitars and even glockenspiels. they throw in a spacey guitar in the background once in a while. they write poetic lyrics and love to build their songs to climaxes. and they are extremely acclaimed. seemed like a recipe for success. but as i finally got around to this i ended up somehow disappointed i am proud to say i resisted the urge to work in a pun with let downs pre-chorus. i guess to understand my reaction to this album that i find in all honesty inconsistent i would have to compare my opinion on two acclaimed songs from it  no surprises and let down. i adore no surprises. the insistent yet soft vocal line rubs back and forth like an ice cube on your forehead chilling you deeper and deeper with its sombre bitter lyrics. then the chorus comes  it is a bit dense and non-climactic like a good number of moments on this album but still  no alarm and no surprises please  is too powerful not to touch  so even that more musically crowded moment works well. when you listen to it in the context of the album you also notice the space  that guitar line comes in with just enough reverb to give it depth while not making it too dilated  and when the glockenspiel and acoustic guitar come in your ears are still open wide enough to hear thom yorke properly and focus on his voice. not to mention the hypnotic nature of that main guitar line  absolutely the loveliest riff on this album. let down is fairly different. it starts with a layered into that gets even more layered as rock instruments come in. thom yorke come in lost behind the instruments enunciating a poetic verse about alienation. i do more or less like that part but it is so distant. then there is that short chorus with unclimactic mini-vocal lines that i find too skeletic to have actual anthemic power. then other verse bridge it all seems to get noisier and more crowded. the climatic  you know where you are when  part is barely noticeable in that pile of notes. it is meant to be like that i realise now but if you factor in thoms peculiar style of mumbling and the vocal effects i find it to become borderline soupy  and that is what happens in many tracks on the album. is it the point that these songs sound like busy streets and factories ? it probably is given the acclaim given to this record  radiohead would not be canonized if they would created something that achieved the opposite of their intent. but if i would had a stressful day i just would not want to listen to something as busy insistent and cleanly noisy as electioneering. and that is just me of course  i am not here to say an album older than i am who has more 5s on here than i have had hot meals is an emotional failure. to concentrate on the positives once again i have only love for the iconic riff-fest and twisted melody pantheon of paranoid android and exit music for a film being the most well-aerated song on the record always succeeds in bringing more-or-less touching feelings of absolute weariness. climing up the walls also conveys its sombre themes quite well with its intimidating greyish rhythm  and airbag is just a very good alt-rock tune. so it is not wasted time for me as i have found a lot to like  but overall it neither touches me nor may i mange to truly  perceive  the greatness i am missing. but true greatness in art is a myth anyway  the greatness is built by the cumulated love people have had for one specific work and so this remains one of the greatest albums of all time -and on this site perhaps the greatest indeed.,0
so i decided to listen to this seeing as it was the most acclaimed music on the website. i intentionally never went after radiohead because i did not like what i heard from them on my radio. creep was okay and i did not want to go into this album with a negative bias. so i went on a jog and listened to the album start to finish. i am not saying the album is bad i am just rating based on my personal feelings because music is subjective and nothing is ever truly good great or bad merely because that is just how you feel. there is no way somebody elses opinion on an album is the exact same as yours thought for thought. this album just demonstrates what i hate about alternative rock. songs like airbag paranoid android and climbing up the walls are slow to get through and did not do anything for me. the production is the biggest problem here as it dates the album and specifically dates it to a period in music where i just feel like there was not much of anything good. whoever their vocalist is he just is not cutting it and his voice sounds annoying to me. the drum sound is annoying and they keyboards do not do anything interesting to me. the guitar is interesting at certain parts though. it is not like i did not like anything. i thought exit music for a film had decent things about it albeit mired by the vocals and dated production. i actually thought let down was good and there were some decent moments on lucky. overall though i did not enjoy this if you do good on you for liking something i do not. kid aradiohead,0
while it is a legendary album i am not seeing how radiohead predicted the future. it is mostly shallow observations about the potential damage of a society reliant on technology. it is kind of cringe bro. boomers trash on the internet and technology all the time but because radiohead expressed that opinion artfully they are right and boomers are still wrong. wtf? aside from the albums ethos radioheads political vision here is indicative of their musical vision. they were creating a musical world of the pristine and sterile stereotype we tend to think the future will pan out as. truly like nothing they have done prior or even after. it does sound like a futuristic u2 with the melodramatic suave and spaciness. i have always though thom was inspired by bonos singing but with time it is not as accurate. while i think ok computer has some iconic tracks it is overrated and contains too many mid tracks for a goat release.,0
people make it sound like the best album ever but it is not. obviously it is not bad musically for me ok computer has nothing special and it is just another alternative rock album.,0
se solo tom yorke non cantasse se solo i suoi compagni lo avessero preso a bastonate e tolto il microfono di mano quando spesso e volentieri si lanciava in quegli irritanti tentativi di canto melodico sofferto se solo... magari considerei questo disco discreto. ma forse neppure dato che musicalmente non gli trovo nulla di interessante.,0
the album title is ironic because it. truely describes what i think about this album.. it is ok. lol. it has some awesome moments but sometimes i felt so unhappy listening to this. i felt depressing after i heard this and i did not like that so i had to put on some old classics after this. the only song that did not make me depressed was electoneerring. that song had that classic rock sound i was hoping i was going to hear more. i thought radiohad had some cool songs creep but this was nothing like that.,0
ok computer is a masterpiece. that much is i feel not up to debate. if a piece of art maintains such a firm hold on its cultural zeitgeist holding a legacy as an embodiment and a pinnacle of a particular moment then there is no other word for it. the ultimate impossibility of ok computer however is separating it from that moment. it is not a living work it is a relic a point in time where pop culture was on the precipice of a shift. the epistemic value of the album as an art form in fact every structure of our lives was up in the air as the digital age loomed over us building a tension for the oncoming antisocial singularity of at-home consumerism and distance as the norm. ok computers cover art its photo negative cityscape with dapples of pop art depicts the new worlds life out of balance the reggio-esque blurred out dirge of modernity now pictured as distinctly unnatural anti-natural in form. radioheads vision of the world is one only possible in the age of the personal computer and the dissociations which come through an irreversibly interconnected world. just as life in the coming millennium the photograph is a blurred swirl of light disjointed from its meaning. and so it is for the album proper. nowhere is this dystopian perspective more obvious than fitter happier my personal favorite track on ok computer. it is here that the band properly embrace synthetic sounds enclosing the piece in atmospheric waves of droning noise while a somber piano piece seeps through its layers of distortion. against it is a collection of sampled dialogue too quiet to make out while in the foreground you hear a text-to-speech poetry reading of the best words yorke has ever written. it is a series of fragments a narrative generated from their connection the piece is written as a free association of points with the line drawn in its execution portraying the ideal life of a modern citizen key words more productive. it is a life with the edges sanded off falling into a dull middle ground  enjoy a drink now and then slower and more calculated a pig in a cage on antibiotics. the power that this capitalist ideal has is one of ideological influence the structure of life itself serving as a pedagogy for the production of good workers obedient and fallow. it worms the imperfections into ones subconscious while we create an image of normalcy for ourselves cogs which collapse slowly inward. the flashes of violence in the imagery providing descriptions of cruelty to animals as broken repressed urges ones which only exist in the back of the mind and can never be expressed or dealt with for fear of the consequences which result of being marked as an outsider. the song points outward and inward its threadbare imagery serving to illuminate a societal authoritative web of ideology. this is generally the mode which makes radiohead perform at their best abstraction with a clear direction. there is a clear sense of sonic worldbuilding in something like fitter happier something which translates to the more rock-oriented sound of airbag which truly sounds like the albums cover art. the guitar melody which introduces it feels almost like pure melody an indescribably fluid sound which provides something of an opening theme for the album. it fully captures what the album sets out to do which is examine and represent a world of evanescent glimmers of life. airbag is the sound of a breath building to a climax of a quietus which introduces radioheads growing cultural vocabulary taking the alt rock style they honed on the bends and expanding it out to tinges of progressive rock and trip hop. it moves them into a new space which generally feels more exhilarating and modern. its sterility is backed up through an emotional range which was not present on the first two albums which makes the highpoints more effective. the problems come when the group shy away from that atmosphere opting for more hooky energetic music. electioneering is frankly the worst song radiohead has ever made they cannot effectively sell this kind of heavier rock sound and the result is an awkward mess of a bland riff with thom yorke shouting outside of what he can do interestingly. it is the highest energy that the album reaches and it feels completely out of place. the lyrics as well are uncharacteristically straightforward where fitter happier points to a world out of balance electioneering instead exclaims its message while maintaining an imprecise attitude towards it. it critiques the platonic ideal of a politician but the subject has no ties to any party or alignment. it simply goes down the middle critiquing a subject we all know is corrupt there is no power to its protests as they are directionless. in more of a craft issue however the album fails in its most ambitious moments exit music for a film for example is built around an overwhelming crescendo but both its rise and conclusion are far too abrupt to have weight. more consistently disappointing though is paranoid android which is a suite in the vein of wings band on the run or queens bohemian rhapsody but it shifts between its moments too quickly failing the atmosphere which it often comes very close to building. what it comes down to is that ok computer has higher highs and lower lows than anything radiohead had done to this point. ultimately that might be what makes its legacy particularly fascinating it is anything but mediocre diving into a strange auteurism which is irreplaceable. while they are fully derivative of many other bands nobody else could make this particular album at this particular time. the blend they discovered here is lightning in a bottle counter-culture which lands at a time which makes its ideals completely natural and ordinary for the world at large. it is the definition of middle-brow something which provides a pleasant challenge and rewards a focused listen just slightly more than their mainstream contemporaries did.,0
i only like track 11 on this album. there is a nice free-flowing tune and a nice atmosphere. elsewhere the only thing i found to be above average is atmosphere on tracks 3 and 5 with plenty of bells and whistles. beyond that everything is average at best. there are hardly any riffs the melodies are mostly mediocre the vocalist is rather mediocre and the sound  production and atmosphere are mostly average or non-existent with the above exceptions. i gave this best album of all times all the respect i could muster with at least 10 spins over a period of about as many years. it peaked at about 7th-8th listen when i thought i might eventually like the thing. however after that the level of enjoyment dropped sharply and during my final listen i did not manage to complete a single song apart from track 11 because they all sounded utterly boring. from 0-10 riffs 2 sound  production 6 tunes 4 vocals 5 atmosphere 6 song structure 5 consistency 5 originality 5 heaviness flyweight accessibility 2-3 listens lastability 5,0
i am not going to sit here and say this albums overrated because they had to have done something right in order to garner this much acclaim. i just did not get the appeal,0
probabilmente laura di magia che li circonda la sconfinata ammirazione che molti nutrono per i radiohead  persino eccessiva ma con buona pace dei loro detrattori se ne crea ovviamente un nugolo non indifferente per ogni band che sale alla ribalta hanno indubbiamente saputo creare uno stile originale e questo disco ne  una delle rappresentazioni pi importanti una mescolanza di pop rock in parte anche noise elettronica con accenti malinconici e scariche di energia e in questo senso la suite paranoid android ben condensa gli esiti della ricerca musicale che viene portata avanti con il disco. si tratta insomma di un gruppo che merita quantomeno la maggior parte della stima e della fama che i pi gli hanno sempre accordato.,0
this rating is a joke because i think it is funny i have the highest rated on this site at 0.5,0
i would preface this review by saying that my opinions are controversial but really how controversial can anything be when there is already a surplus of opinions from every perspective? the first thought i had when i started listening to this album was crap did my equalizer blow out again? it is almost uncanny how much the mixing on this track resembles the default settings on my headphones. my second thought was intriguesure the lyrics are edgy but i had an emo phase so i have heard much worse. besides there is a kind of hypnotic quality to the music and i was happy to even be thinking about the lyrics because that meant that it was not boring enough harmonically for me to lose interest. truly the first three songs and maybe the fourth if i am feeling kind are greatthere are obvious flaws of course the droning vocals are a hit or miss for example but there is at least a baseline confidence in the execution. by let down they have started to lose me i have heard too many songs on otherwise strong albums that try to use polyrhythms as their gimmick in place of real songwriting. i have no strong feelings on karma police. fitter happier is not exactly bad but it is not at all what i was expecting. then i am zoning out again. i am brought back by no surprises but mostly because it sounds more like something panic! at the disco would write than the art rock i was promised. the final songs try to reclaim some of what made the first few work but it is too little too late. again from the first three songs alone i get the hype. i can even understand why people love the other onesthe execution is clearly excellent. but i guess i am not one of those people.,0
there is only like 2 songs worth listening to here but the rest of it is not necessarily horrible by any means. probably the most overrated album of all time considering that the people on this site decide it deserves the 1 overall spot but it is also just completely harmless and i have no personal gripes with it. just not as great as people make it out to be. it is no masterpiece,0
loved by many hated by many as well radioheads third and most critically acclaimed album is without a doubt a very important album even several years after its release. while their earlier releases gained traction by getting released in an era of a huge britpop revival owed by a large factor to bands like oasis and blur this album is a significant step away from that sound. while the song structures are still based on the same formulas as those first two albums the sounds they incorporate and the production drives them towards a more modern sounding approach and a futuristic approach as implied by the title. the sparse use of electronics is done in a subtle and effective way adding dreamy soundscape like textures and enriching the compositions. keyboards and string arrangements are also used throughout the course of the album creating a dense melancholic atmosphere. the opening track airbag hints on the change of sound but is somewhat lacking and fails to hold the listeners attention. paranoid android and karma police are two of the most well known songs from the album simple catchy melodies delivered in a confident tone that perfectly captures a band in transition but with enough experience to sound adventurous and massively appealing at the same time. exit music for a film is probably the most depressive moment on the album relying on a very soft acoustic guitar melody and thom yorkes almost wailing vocal performance to provide an emotional release. the album does get a little repetitive near the mid point with songs like electioneering and climbing up the walls failing to provide to much in the mix without them being bad. it all pays up in the end though with no surprises and lucky being two of the finest moments on the album relying on the pessimistic tone that the whole album is built upon to offer a sense of final release from the sweet melancholy that runs throughout the album. while ok computer is not their most experimental or their most groundbreaking effort it is definitely the finer point at which they found the perfect balance between being experimental and accessible. it is true that the album has received a lot more attention than it deserves from a musical standpoint but its influence and importance in the direction art rock and several forms of indie rock would move in the years to come is unparalleled. music wise it is undoubtedly a very good album that manages to sound fresh and enjoyable even after all those years. it is the album that transformed radiohead from followers to leaders and established them as a huge name in the music industry granting them the freedom to experiment with their sound without having to worry too much resulting in some very interesting albums in the years to come.,0
i mean it is the best rated album here but is it really like that? it is really really good and the best radiohead album in my opinion. the whole record has a nice atmosphere and in general is a well built album but how some people wrestled it as the best album in the world i do not really understand but anyway it is a wonderful album,0
very pretty good. a victim of overhype. it is a good album it is a great reflection of drab modern society yada yada yada. it is also slow and at times a little boring. fitter happier is a pretentious song. are those bad things to say? i do not care.,0
i am almost 32 and it is the first time i listen to ok computer the highest rated album on this page for this moment. i would been hating this band for no reason but i decided to give it a chance once and i already passed the kid a test and it turned out to be not as bad as i thought 35 stars. in my opinion it was musically way more interesting than ok computer which is kind of regular but not one of the worst 90s rock. but the worst thing about this album is thom yorkes vocal if they replaced it with that voice synthesizer from fitter happier this would get a star more. when it is the way it is yorke ruins like everything and some of these tracks might have been okayish subterranean etc. and electioneering. still it is not that bad for 90s rock but... it is not any good either.,0
let us write my first review after using rym for 15 years. why not start with ryms and countless publications  1 album ok computer? the title of best album ever is a set-up for disappointment. so on first listen about ten years ago i was underwhelmed. nowadays after listening to these songs at least once a year i am just whelmed i suppose. i can understand why people like this album but the best album off all time? that seems like a stretch. mind you this is in no way a bad album. if you rate this half a star you are probably an edgelord. sonically or instrumentally it does not do anything new or interesting. it is just standard alternative rock. thom yorke voice is often described as whiny. i do not disagree but it does not bother me i can appreciate a wide range of voices. however i do not relate to him at all. he leaves me emotionally unbothered. some songs are genuinely good like karma police let down and lucky. other ones like airbag no suprises and subterranean homesick alien are perfectly enjoyable. the rest of the songs including paranoid android are just there. they exist. they are competent. but i do not feel the need to listen to them again. best song let down worst song fitter happier.,0
from how i see it this is a mostly forgettable but still enjoyable rock record from the 90s. nothing terribly groundbreaking but some decent songs and one fantastic moment in fitter happier. maybe if i knew more about the backstory of the record i would get it but as of now its decent not much more and i probably will not be returning to it anytime soon but decent none the less. 610,0
edit while my opinion on this album has not changed overtime this review goes against all review writing philosophies i have developed overtime. this is my first radiohead record which was long overdue however it had to happen at one point. to start off i really loved the vocals on this record along with some of the songwriting metaphors. on tracks like lucky where vocals are very well expressed and drive the song these traits really pop out. i did not really care much for the overall theme of the record of a dystopian robot ruled world but it fleshes itself out pretty well. the instrumentals are kind of whatever for me it is just some pretty typical alternative rock music. on the song electioneering the whole track sounds very classical in it is composition but i really appreciated it with the singers vocals. one of the more standout tracks and my favourite personally is exit music for a film which is really stripped back but progresses into something a lot more. i believe it highlights all of the best parts of this record quite aptly. all in all this is pretty solid. but this guy needs a band creative as he is i think.,0
i feel like this album has a weird paradox surrounding it. it feels as if this is an album where if you dislike it people can just say you do not like it because you are trying to be a contrarian imagine not liking ok computer it is so good how could you not like it? however if you like it you are just following the crowd what a pathetic sheep. so basically having an opinion on this album the 1 album on this website is just a total waste of time. chances are if you say you dislike this album then you are like me you do not actually dislike the album you just do not think it is as good as it is rated to be. that is all it boils down to for me. of course this album has good moments it can be exciting and emotional within the same track and that is quite impressive. it sounds better than the bends which probably is not too difficult but credit where credit is due. i always go into an album hoping to like the music because that only means more music for me and by mathematical means i do like this album it is over a 5 so i like it. but not enough to listen to it often. i went into this being convinced that on previous listens i thought it was really good but tonight after listening to it again i find myself quite disappointed that i did not like it as much as i thought i would. ideas got weirdly repetitive quickly within and across tracks. i found myself thinking some of the tracks sounded a bit too similar just sad alt-rock songs. my biggest issue is that it all sounds way too serious when the sound absolutely does not warrant the tone. electioneering is probably the only song where it sounds as if they had fun making it even though the entire album has the same instrumentals. i am not sure how they achieved that but they did in my eyes they did anyway. regardless of my opinions on the bends and pablo honey at least they were fun. musically this album is quite a bit better than both but it could have been better if it was not so... as it is. oh well guess it is 1 for a reason. rating - 7.510,0
cold atmosphere of the songs combined with thom yorkes falsetto sounds too unlikable and sharp like a knife especially in paranoid android. luckily he does not in that range often. some of the lyrics are quirky but i have gotten used to them. even with these problems the songs are still emotional greatly produced and gorgeous. worst song exit music for a film,0
the singles were amazing but i never have the urge to just listen to the entire thing some of the deep cuts are kind of boring i think they got alot better at making ambiance sound exciting on kid a like i feel like a 2000s era radiohead would have made let down sound so much more interesting or literally half the tracklist for that.,0
oh boy it is the big one! as someone who was a big radiohead fan in my early years of high school this was unsurprisingly a staple of my musical listening back then. while i have moved past my short phase of disdain for this album and i do have a favorable opinion of it now i cannot say i was particularly blown away here. sure tracks like airbag and fitter happier are absolute wonders but a lot of this just feels like the bends but more inspired. this serves it is place in music history and music culture particularly online but i cannot say i view this as the shining gem of music as a whole that many do. i will say though- this album begins the trend of radioheads strongest asset being their great sense of atmosphere woven into every release... something that would then be elaborated on in a much more fulfilling manner just a few short years later.,0
this is a hard one to rate. this album plus many other works by radiohead defined my teen years and was a foundation for a lot of my music taste. in order to properly rate this though i need to take the nostalgia bias out... and that is difficult for me. the other bias i feel i need to take out is how hard it is been shilled by the media over the years and on this site as well at the time of writing it is the 1 album of all time and does not look like it is going to move. still listening to this album again i cannot help but sing along... in my opinion this is a transitional album from their angst and pep of their previous era starting to mold into their more moody and experimental output to come later. unfortunately this leads to me having some confusion upon listening to this album again. it is hard to tell what this album wants to be. is it singer-songwriter rock? or is it experimental art rock? i just cannot seem to see the contents here as a single entity instead it feels like a tug-of-war. i will focus on the songwriting first. there are some extremely good moments of awesome here paranoid android still an awesome song but there are also some times where i feel like the songwriting is empty and only there to create a product more of their poppier structured songs. however i do not feel there is any inherently bad songs on here. i think that likely contributes heavily to the current site rating. some of these songs rock out so hard. then there is the experimentation. a lot of it feels like it was just placed on to be alternative or weird and i ate that up when i was a teenager but these days it just feels like a mundane distraction. fitter happier is a pretty decent idea but is so depressing compared to the rest of the album that it does not seem to fit so well with me. i also have some miscellaneous thoughts - i have a personal hatred for instruments being panned hard to one side sorry but i dock any album for this - phil selways drumming is incredibly underrated - i am so incredibly desensitized by this album due to me playing it so much as a teenager. most songs just do not hit it for me anymore as i think my taste has changed a lot. paranoid android is my absolute favorite here. it was one of my favorites when i was younger and still is so awesome to me. i am going to give this a 4-star. i think that is the best i can give it. edit i dropped this to a 3.5... i think it is essential to the genre but it is not my thing.,0
i cannot listen to this anymore. it makes my stomach boil. every song is a depressing mockup of sincerity drenched in false platitudes about the rustling intermediacy of modern life and its foibles. the burrowing antiquities undersold inside the brain field of diametric openings cannot be ignored. thom yorkes voice is the voice of a foolish wizard in the farmhouse. we hear the song but no reverberations. paranoid android is okay.,0
this is so boring. his vocals are horribly whiny and the songs just drag into nowhere.,0
y-yeah this album totally sucks guys... r-right? i am totally original and hip for disagreeing with the majority of people on a site populated by hipsters. i am a free thinker unlike most of you. i am now going to post about this on a cambogian basketweaving forum i found on instagram. w-what? i am not insecure about my music taste. worst album ever made. period.,0
a smashing effort on radioheads behalf ok computer proves to labels that experimental music can too be popular and celebrated in the commercial sense. structure-wise the album cradles the listener through worlds and dimensions of isolation alienation and troubles of fitting in. as an appropriate touch on the albums closer the tourist thom yorke pleads the listener to slow down a climactic and downtempo end.,0
i have never liked this one as much as kid a or even the bends for that matter in over a decade of listening. i have never been able to quite put my finger on what it is about the album that puts me off but if i took a stab i would suggest it is its occasional overproduction likely intentional ice-cold aesthetic half-baked incorporation of looped samples and the very 90s shittalker ver. 1.2-esque robot. that and i can no longer stand the eternally overplayed karma police and no surprises. still i am glad ok computer stressed out thom enough that the band went on to create masterpiece kid a and there are a lot of beautiful moments and elements here that would inspire much of their later work. airbag let down and the tourist are my somewhat unpopular picks. 3.5 stars  good,0
it is practically impossible to write about radioheads third album without addressing the massive amount of acclaim and hype spawned from its mere existence. by the time of its release various critics and publications were already hailing it as an instant classic and were calling the band the beatles of our generation. that is quite a commendation and on the surface it seems true after all both are english rock bands whose hit singles garnered them international fame and whose successful albums proved highly inspiring to countless artists of their generation many of whom tried to imitate their style. meanwhile the band continued to experiment beyond their comfort zone and change up their sound amidst growing divisive opinions. but going beyond mere surface comparisons shows that the two groups are nothing alike at all. the beatles primarily wrote cheery catchy almost simplistic rock songs about love and happiness alongside some fantastic covers of classic rb tunes while radiohead are known for creating self-pity anthems and art-rock songs about anxiety fear fatalism and other equally depressing themes. also the beatles had each of the four members singing competently at some point and generally on their own song while radiohead are almost always reduced to one singer who is overly angst-ridden vocal performance often becomes too much to take in. why do i harp on this point so much? well it shows to my satisfaction just how unsophisticated and drone-like the consensus surrounding radiohead is ironic given their album that seeks to preach against such feeble-minded conformity and represents part of why i find the constant comparisons made between the two bands and to radiohead albums in general highly insufferable. seriously when i see reviews on this site that compare older albums to pablo honey dylans self-titled debut or amnesiac rolling stones tattoo you i question why i even bother trying to skillfully articulate my opinions. it is obvious that dreary albums like ok computer appeal to the majority of the ryms demographic and i can understand why radioheads art-rock influences lend an atmospheric quality to the music that evokes the most famous film soundtracks which when combined with yorkes sorrowful voice resonates with the lonely depressive largely online types. but as a hardcore fan of song-form and traditional tunes i find much of the album lacking enough engrossing sounds and interesting lyrics to justify its vapid pink floyd imitations. to make my perspective on ok computer as clear as possible i will compose a track-by-track analysis of my thoughts while listening intently to the album airbag i actually enjoy this opening track quite a bit. the flowing guitar riffs and dj shadow inspired drum delay succeed at establishing a somewhat inspiring mood right out of the gate. i also like how the structure of the lyrics help the songs pacing along nicely. thom yorke is certainly not the greatest rock singer in the world but i will say his agonized voice delivers the message competently enough for the song to work. i am not as fond of the ending with it is mundane background textures in place of engaging instrumentation but it is not a deal-breaker. paranoid android a huge step down from the effective opener this 6-and-a-half-minute-long track is a tedious mess of horrible lyrics dreadful vocals and obnoxious distortion effects that fail to earn the comparisons to the classic rock anthems bohemian rhapsody and happiness is a warm gun. the song starts off fine enough but only gets worse as it goes along with yorkes vocals morphing into the kind of whiny adolescent pitch that made the bends such a laborious record to sit through and with his lyrics devolving into artsy babble that reads like he wrote them while drunk or sleep-deprived and never bothered to edit it after the fact. the unconventional structure only serves to make the music seem very unorganized and at times jarring and the end result is very unsatisfying to listen to. but my biggest problem is that i just do not sympathize with yorkes cynical disposition nor do i get much from his angsty vocal performance. apparently yorke claims the title of the song is a joke and that the phrase with your opinionwhich is of no consequence at all is one as well and he is right it is a joke i just do not find it funny at all. subterranean homesick alien a homage to the classic dylan tune in name only this somber and moody track is one of the more entertaining parts of the album mainly because yorkes vocals are kept in check here and the guitars are consistently melodic. in terms of lyrical ability thom remains rather blunt and uncreative - they are alluptightuptightuptightuptightuptightuptight goes the chorus. it is worth noting that the second verse ends with i am alrightalright before reverting back to the chorus with i am justuptight which i guess is his way of proving he is somewhat self-aware. i think my biggest disconnect from this album so far comes from my lack of relatability to yorkes ever-present theme of alienation as reflected in the way he so condescendingly embraces his kinship with these hypothetical aliens over his human companions. exit music for a film a slower track which starts as a quiet acoustic guitar song then adds some eerie vocal chants as background texture before finally climaxing in a loud electronic wave of sound. the tracks lyrical allusions to romeo and juliet feel largely unoriginal and the song itself feels a touch melodramatic in it is presentation but i guess it is transition from quiet to loud accomplishes what it sets out to do well enough that i cannot complain. let down i love the arpeggio guitars and unique electronic rhythm and find yorkes emotional performance on this song his best yet but i have begun to grow weary from his predictable metaphors i am going to grow wingsa chemical reaction - it is a butterfly get it! and his seldom compelling way of detailing his boredom with modern life and technology starting and then stoppingtaking off and landingthe emptiest of feelings - yes i have felt exhausted having to wait on transportation too thom. karma police i have gone back and forth on this one initially hating it then kind of liking it and now i just feel very meh on it. i find its noisy electronic coda incredibly annoying and feel like yorkes attempt to imitate fascist fun-hating censors make him sound as hollow and robotic as the people he is mocking. i also do not really feel anything from its deliberate deadbeat drumming other than a constant source of tedium. not terrible but also not captivating in the slightest. fitter happier in case paranoid android subterranean homesick alien and karma police have not already drilled the idea of humans-becoming-alienated-due-to-a-robotic-compliance-with-the-normalized-standard-of-living into your brain here comes this dreary monotonous overtly dystopian spoken-word track to hammer the beyond understood point home. electioneering the most abrasive guitar song on the album by far here is where they kind of sorta pretend to act political in a rather slapdash send-up of election interference and voodoo economics. it is like someone read a book about politics and was fascinated by several buzzwords and phrases but could not figure out a way to write an intriguing song about the subject to contrast a superb example of a song that manages to convey its political message while remaining musically engaging is washington bullets by the clash. the music itself might come across as a bit overblown and yorkes screechy vocals might feel like overkill but it does serve as a nice respite from the usual dreary nonsense. climbing up the walls easily my least favorite track on the album. featuring horrible production loud stale drums and a noisy assortment of effects including distorted vocals and ridiculous lyrics i have got the smell of a local manwho is got the loneliest feeling attempting to personify paranoia as well as fellow abstract concepts fear and anxiety in an embarrassing effort at writing a scary song. and just to make things worse it has another obnoxious electronic ending one that sounds like several car horns layered on top of one another. no surprisesthis calm simple melody feels like a relief after the disaster of the previous track. the lyrics are more generic cynicism and fatalism that yorke seems to believe are incredibly compelling and deep but that i find shallow and pretentious. at least the vocals are delivered clearly this time albeit in a more robotic tone of voice how ironic or is it intentional?. bring down the governmentthey do notthey do not speak for us may sound like a bold political statement but since in the context of the song it is just another fleeting thought in the mind of a suicidal depressive it hardly counts. also such a pretty houseand such a pretty garden comes across as a meaningless jab at suburban housing and feels spiteful and bitter instead of relatable. lucky the penultimate track and the first of two largely tepid closing songs that fail to arouse my interest. a repeat of the near-death-experience-making-one-feel-invincible theme from the first track only presented in a much less captivating way. maybe if the lyrics were more engrossing or at the very least not so full itself although again maybe that is the point and i just do not get it then i would like it more. still i find it difficult to care about - much less relate to - yorkes disturbed personas even with the gloomy guitar riffs providing a steady pace. the tourist the final track and what a bore it is with lukewarm rhythms and another uninspired chorus hey manslow downslow down which both add up to a dull finale to a mediocre album. the music can hardly sustain my attention at this point and the vocals are nothing special. that is not even to mention what passes up for stale background fodder. in summary most of the album is competent musically but the aurally satisfying moments are brought down by banal lyrics subpar singing annoying distortion and dated electronic effects. as i have stated i get why it appeals to so many on here. the simplified and direct lyrics the electronically-infused art-rock tracks the themes of isolation and paranoia even the desperately angst-ridden vocals all succeed at catering to the types of people who search for albums like ok computer to make their sorrows feel more relatable and real. the point of this review is not to say that others are wrong for liking this album or even for believing it to be the greatest musical achievement in recent history. i simply want to make it clear that my dissatisfaction with the album comes not from it is massive popularity or critical outpouring scornful as i may be of those who so routinely compare radiohead to other artists especially the beatles but rather from my disconnect with yorke and his ideas. when i first heard the album i will admit i did relate to it more and thought i liked it enough to purchase it on itunes but i never saw it as the masterpiece the internet hyped it up as. having discovered many more gratifying and more relatable albums since then i find little reason to return to ok computers constant air of doom and gloom. thoms angst just comes across as immature and whiny and although tom verlaine does not have the nicest sounding voice either his songs are usually more fun and meaningful and not as pathetically morose. i hope it is clear why i refuse to acknowledge this record as a classic or as a masterpiece and why it does little for me personally. if anything i feel more confident in my opinion that radiohead albums in general are overhyped and that they are nowhere near the level of mastery and musical pleasure that the beatles possessed. and i should not have to say this but it is only my opinion and i am no more correct than the countless reviews endlessly praising it are wrong.,0
i enjoy the album a lot more than the original but the b-sides are very incomplete compared to those of amnesiac or the bends which could very well be finished songs.,0
wow i do not get it at all. how is this the 1 rated album on this site? i would get something like in the court of the crimson king the dark side of the moon or to pimp a butterfly. even loveless i could understand being 1 more than this. but this? no. it sounds like a pretty standard alternative rock album to me with slight experimentation. almost none of the riffs are interesting or creative. thom yorkes vocals get on my nerves. i do not like his weird vibrato and i do not particularly like his timbre. i mean i did not expect to like this album but i did not expect to dislike it this much. i also do not like how lethargic it is. this album has very few moments of energy. also one of my big issues with the album is just how gloomy it is. and it is not that i do not like any sad music. but this feels overly melancholic. it is not the type of melancholy where you can feel the sadness of the artist but the type where it just sounds dull and tedious. the whole thing just feels like a slog to get through. as for positives airbag had a cool intro riff and paranoid android has a cool riff at 222. the verses of karma police are not bad. and there are other elements of a few songs that are decent. but overall this is not made for me at all. and while i can somewhat see the appeal in it even accounting for the fact that lyrically this album tackled some unique issues and dictated the style of british rock for the next decade i do not get the massive praise it is gotten on this site.,0
i am not really sure why this album is the 1 rated album on the website. i mean yeah this album was pretty cool at the time i guess. i had the cd back then for my sony discman and i guess i enjoyed it more than their other first half-dozen albums. but at the end of the day this is basically just 90s alt-rock. ok sure it is a weird prog-influenced offshoot of 90s alt-rock but i do not think this album has aged tremendously well. contrast this against in rainbows which never expects to age. and ok computer is neither as catchy nor as deep as the flaming lips masterpiece the soft bulletin from about the same period. so i cannot elevate this beyond the level of a pretty good 35 highlights paranoid android this song is a bit uneven however with the eerie acoustic first half dominating the abrasive electric second half the slow-burning climactic exit music for a film the catchy karma police i am going to their signature song over creep the avant-garde jazzy climbing up the walls no track on this album has grown on me more over time than this one and the one-two gut punch at the end lucky  the tourist so that is a fair number of highlights. at the end of the day this is a good album -- i would say my 2nd favorite radiohead album overall but thom yorkes shrill voice has always grated on my eardrums and large sections of this album are just abrasive and ugly. take airbag for instance. i guess this is supposed to be a fan favorite? but it is possibly my least favorite track on the album after you throw out fitter happier if not the overly jangly electioneering... actually yeah i think electioneering is worse  unlistenable. i just think the guitar intro to airbag is ugly and thom yorkes vocals are decidedly whiny on this track it kind of reminds me of fake plastic trees which is not only the worst radiohead song i have ever heard but probably in my top three most hated songs of all-time. even one of my favorite tracks climbing up the walls has that awful 30 seconds of distortion at the end of the track. so i am not really a fan. in rainbows is way better having fewer weak tracks and a more pleasant sound aesthetic overall.,0
this album is ok. definitely do not think it is the best album of all time. it feels so self-serious at times but the biggest issue for me is that there is almost nothing on it to really excite me. not bad by any means but i do not think it deserves all the acclaim it has.,0
radiohead are probably the one band that has changed the most within my conscious over these past years of musical exploration exploitation and reinvestment. i have gone from hating just about every album they have made to loving every single album the band has released more than any other except for one. yes this is a review of that one album. that one album happens to be what has been hailed as the greatest album of the last two decades by literally thousands of critics and fans alike. so why do not i enjoy this? what is there to blame? well the reasons are lost. i do not know why. i never knew why. i cannot really say that it is this bands smugness that turns me off. i managed to completely love the bends for months upon months without ever catching on to how horribly pretentious and annoying it was. it is not the acclaim either though i adored amnesiac for being a mistake album. i also absolutely loved kid a which falsifies both of these reasons likelihood. it is not the art rock atmosphere that this provides as in rainbows is an absolutely glorious piece. it is not even that i prefer their more electronic side pablo honey has gained love for being simplistic. i still enjoy every album in some shape or form as well so it is not as if i have grown out of any of them. it is more that the albums reflect a place and time in life and i think that ok computer expresses my complete ignorance within the vast universe of musical landscapes and monuments. i did not understand the album upon first listen. hell how was i supposed to? it is completely alien to my mind circa 2007. i had no idea who radiohead were or why everybody loved them so much. i had not heard any of those enormous art rock names. the velvet underground. king crimson. david bowie. i only actually knew radiohead by how everyone else my age knew them creep. of course i listened to pablo honey first. this is the time where i loved the album most. i listened to the bends and already felt that they were growing as a band. and at the time that was a scary idea. i mean here is this 13 year old kid that loved black sabbath when they played paranoid. acdc when they played with bon scott. metallica when they had cliff. change was scary. and i hated ok computer because of this. but what was weird was that i did not hate the later albums as much. kid a made me feel smart. amnesiac made me feel dumb. hail to the thief reminded me of the bends so i went back and listened to that a few more times and ended up replacing pablo honey as my favorite album by radiohead. and with time i really did manage to warm up to a few songs from this album mostly thanks to the guidance of fellow rym members. let down quickly rose as being my favorite song of all time. i was reading through reviews of this album on day and saw someone the name escapes me noting the absolute angelical of a keyboard arpeggio in let down. naturally i went and investigated not remembering anything of the sort before. and my mind was blown. i actually paid attention to what was happening in this album and discovered why people thought it to be so great. i tried doing so with other songs but that proved to be more difficult. i set it aside once more but decided to investigate kid as tracks as well. i was blown away once more. i will fast-forward past my amnesiac days which i believe are aptly covered within my review of that album already. we will send myself to the present actually. what i am listening to right now. airbag has revealed itself recently as being a cornerstone. a connecting link between the predecessor and the successor. between the bends and ok computer. the guitars feature the same crashingly raw and unrestrained power behind the likes of the bends and my iron lung but also have sonic experimentation that radiohead had begun to explore throughout this album. not only that but the drumming is much more dynamic and exciting to hear now. the tones are not quite the electronic bang and clang that kid a is stuffed to the brim with but is more of a contemporary style with that electronic overdub slipped in. just for fun. thoms vocals took on their new now-familiar delicate tonality. the frailness and openness that makes radiohead a brilliant band. the worth that airbag has as an opener has finally been revealed to me. and really what keeps me coming back to this album time after time and leaving me disappointed more and more. not because it is a bad song. of course not. that is ridiculous. paranoid android has long since become my choice as the greatest song this band has ever conjured. the guitars and drums ripple and intermix so effortlessly and frighteningly that the atmosphere rivals that of the complex and deep ambiance that kid a drowns in so easily. paranoid android is pretty awesome need it even be said? thoms vocals reach all the highs you can imagine and still manage to graze the edges of the lows. paranoid android proves thom yorkes worth as a vocalist. completely. and then all the build-up near the middle always leaves me wondering when thoms going to explode. and then it just... happens. the guitar reverts to the most primal moment of radioheads entire career and then the tremolo picking to bust open the solo maintains its position as my favorite part of any radiohead song. in comes the eerie ambient moaning. the aesthetics of the song shift so suddenly and violently that this new atmosphere is frighteningly alien and abstract. which segues very nicely into the next song on this journey. subterranean homesick alien pays homage to bob dylan of course but is nothing like bob dylan in actuality. bob dylans severely old-fashioned and guitar-driven. it is hard to imagine that anything in this song is guitar at all. it is all very electronic and different from your run-of-the-mill rock music. the guitar tone does rear its head eventually but its sound is still very much enveloped in this new and different sound. something radiohead have not ever truly done before now. this song has always been difficult for me but now it has managed to force me to actually hold back tears of joy. that is a truly rare quality of music. and radiohead take another sharp turn. exit music for a film is entirely somber and sulky. sulk never even got like this. street spirit fade out still had a sense of pop optimism within itself. but this is just drainingly depressive. just one of those songs that just sit staring at your music player. stunned. silenced. kind of gives you the chills maybe. the soundscape is much more subtle this time around as well or thoms voice is just far more prominent. the lyrics are impossibly hard to decipher on the first go or even the twentieth. there exists a sense of deprivation and loss within them but the actual cohesion of language is lost in thoms tortured performance and delivery of them. let down returns to familiarity and comfort. a sort of breather from these heavy-set and revolutionary rounds of songs. bright twanging guitars and a bit more up-tempo thom vocal deliveries. an identifiable refrain as well and the drums have fallen back into a relative state of simplicity. the soundscapes have fallen away and have become once more little more than a wall of guitars. let down has a soothing quality to it if anything. a mellowing chill-out song. the existence of that arpeggio is almost lost within the lulling waves of guitar lapping before it comes right up and hits you with its miraculous beauty. 330 in if you are as curious as i was when i first took a listen. now for the puzzling song that proceeded subterranean homesick alien. the song i never understood the acclaim and love of. the striking piano introduction being blasted into the background by the bass drum which accompanies the vocals arrival as well. kaaaaarmaaa poooliiice arrest this maaan he talks in maths.. those subtle choral vocals during the refrain and how absolutely dissolved and exposed thoms voice presents itself here. as the song signifies its ending with that now-familiar drone of electronic experimentation it acts as a forewarning to what is to come. possibly the strangest song radiohead ever released fitter happier is hard to follow and thoroughly robotic and heartless. going from such an aggressive onslaught of emotional waterfalls and tidal waves hearing the drone and monotone of a robots voice is completely alienating and scary. the calming return of an airbag-esque guitar twang is a refresher. the sleigh bells give way to the cowbells and the guitars peak in their distortion and thoms voice introduces itself again. here though thom is donning a different mask. one more of political frustration and rage rather than what has always been a calm if mournful demeanor. his vocals begin to swirl around quickly and become something of wonder and awe. where this sheer unrestrained power goes by the next song will forever remain a mystery. climbing up the walls codas exit music for a film as well as subterranean homesick alien. with both being brilliant songs that approach the same branch of musical mindset and aesthetic it is no surprise that climbing up the walls is the song that hits every right note. that is legitimately beautiful in how barren and deserted everything about the sound feels. the solemn pounding drums along with the contrastingly weakened guitar electronic and thom tones. the double-layering vocals one featuring yorkes normal range that high falsetto with an absolutely different and distant low-ranging set of vocals in addition to that. the creeping waning electronic soundscaping fits into your mind the idea of something grasping onto life. just barely alive. striving to be more. nothing more majestic truly exists for radiohead. acoustic strumming provides the soundscape for once with the electronic soundscape instead moving into the foreground providing that twinkling chimes of no surprises. thom almost seems to be singing backwards. it is a strange world that thom is in while singing this only truly being able to coherently pronounce the chorus of no surprises. it is a tear-jerking ballad truly. then silence. then screaming. then i want to run. i want to ruuuuuuuun. scraping soundscape fills the void of emptiness just enough to be eerie. the flick of acoustic guitar enters in followed by a set of electric guitar distortion which all just preludes the track opening up and being the full room-filling sound that creeps up only routinely. the sounds quickly fall back into the silence only the build-up has taken root. everything is more powerful. anticipation builds for the return of that power and lucky cannot help but sound like a more adventurous creep. strip away the acoustic guitar that creep replace it with a solitary electronic sound then take away the heavily distorted chorus and add in that room-breaking sound. what have you now? lucky. a reinvention of the past but a proof that radiohead truly did care about pablo honey and what it did. and now. the final song. the closer. this has always been the hardest song for me to comprehend. the tourist is scores of peoples favorite song from here or one of their favorites. but if not for fitter happier i think i would pick the tourist as the weakest song here. it does not quite hit home as hard as lucky and does not have the build-up and release of it either. the tourist is more a meeting of the two words of songs like lucky and songs like exit music for a film. it is pretty but uninteresting at the same time. almost a confused sound. a sound that radiohead finally will discover and capitalize three years following. yes kid a. if this even need be said ok computer has finally opened up its petals. has finally revealed the sweet nectar of lust and glory that every music critic has given it and appraised it for. the circle has been completed. from pablo honey to the bends to kid a to in rainbows to amnesiac to hail to the thief and finally to ok computer. the torch has been passed to its final holder. where it goes from here i do not know. nor do i care.,0
a lot of really cool ideas drowned in a sea of mediocre soft rock balladry and awful vocals,0
most of the songs in the album are nothing special and rather dull but the over all mood of the song is rather atmospheric and depressing. definitely not worthy of being 1 even in its own genre but the only reason its a 3 from me is because there are much worse albums out there,0
i do not really understand the massive amount of acclaim this album gets among the music community. while there are certainly songs on the album that i found to be quite good such as let down and electioneering the majority of the record i found to be quite dull and uninteresting. i understand that a lot of people enjoy this kind of melancholic sound and do not get me wrong i greatly enjoy some depressing sounding albums like joy division and interpol but i feel like the band could have kept the general atmosphere of this album while still adding a little more power to it. i am not saying radiohead are a bad band and i am not giving it this score just to be a contrarian i am just saying this album did not really do it for me in the same way it did for many others. who knows perhaps some of their other albums will win me over.,0
i was sitting in my bedroom longing for a taste and feeling that could present me adequate sustenance. i decided i needed to stand up to satisfy my immense craving. that is what i did. i ventured out of my bedroom for the first time since 1007 pm the night before and traveled into the kitchen. i had reached the kitchen. my appetency was far more brutal than previously i needed to feast. i grabbed a ham egg and cheese hot pocket out of my freezer which was cooled to negative ten degrees fahrenheit. that was it i am now estatic euphoric even. a full sense of irrational manic happiness had breached the walls of my mind. i put my hot pocket in the microwave for two minutes. i gaze at my delicious morsel completing revolutions as the burning radiating ray of light shot the hot pocket with means to become edible. feeding i took my hot pocket out of the microwave. i took in an enormous whiff of the pure culinary genius presented in front of my face. i then took a bite. an orgy took place in my mouth. pure brilliance. discovery i then felt a slight pain in my stomach. oh no i said to myself i have to shit. i had reached my limit of culinary consumption. i ran to the lavatory to relinquish this excrement inside of me. i grabbed my iphone 6 out of my pocket and opened spotify. this is when i saw that an album by an artist i had heard of radiohead was recommended to suit my palette of artistic sound. this was ok computer. i clicked on the play button. immediately my ears faced an unparalleled orgasm caused by the untainted perfection that is ok computer. i had never witnessed anything this unsurpassably magnificent. even as a form of lava was seeping out of my anus i felt at peace. within ten seconds of the album being played i started masturbating. i had to as it was too divine of a stimulation to my ears to abstain. nine hours passed. i had not stopped masturbating to this piece of heavenly brilliance i thought could only exist in a world of idealistic utopias. conflict my mother pounded on the door. i am going to fucking break in if you do not get your ass off of the shitter! she screamed very angrily. i just could not stop stimulating my genitalia to this indefectible marvel. i just could not. i opened the window in the bathroom and climbed out of it. i ran quickly for 1 hour feeling the pain that is chastity. i caught a train i did not know where it was going but i could not live a life without my one and only love in this cruel society of nightmarish anti-individualistic totalitarianism so i seized this opportunity. at peace i was masturbating in the bathroom of this train for twenty-seven hours when it made its final stop in minot north dakota. a rural desolate land i knew i could live here in peace finally endlessly masturbating to ok computer by radiohead. this is where i am and this is where i will stay.,0
whether desired or not radiohead made art and merchandise meet exactly in the middle. and i am buying.,0
so here it is radioheads 1997 album ok computer a delve into the mind of the modern man and artistic turning point for the band. and what a turning point it was. radiohead pre okc was a patchwork of grungy 90s rock clichs but with some pretty good ideas on the bends many of which hinted at what was to come. radiohead post okc is experimental cerebral and altogether strange rock music and it was ok computer that allowed that huge leap to happen. it was here that radiohead began to truly flex their muscles and the real talent of the band finally came through. as such it is significance cannot be overstated. it is quality however can. and has been. repeatedly. enough times to last a lifetime. a glance at this albums critical reception tab on wikipedia will show a 1010 from pitchfork a 1010 from nme and a host of 4 to 5 stars. writer tim footman who apparently loved ok computer to write an entire book about it noted that not since 1967 with the release of sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band had so many major critics agreed immediately not only on an albums merits but on its long-term significance and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history. high praise indeed. first let us talk about themes. yorke writes about dissolusionment with modern life depression mundanity frustration at politics and boredom. i imagine yorke was reading a lot of philip larkin at the time a poet who i would whole-heartedly reccomend to anyone who enjoys the lyrical themes of the album. the instrumentals also tie in very nicely being loaded with glitchy bleeps robot voices and ethereal soundscapes and i will admit not many albums do this to the degree that ok computer does. the theme of boredom however is the one that prevails the most in the instrumentals because it is exactly how the album makes the listener feel. second the tracks. it blows it is load in the first half with paranoid android and exit music providing some much needed excitement that is not found again until electioneering a track that along with no suprises which its suitably chilling artificial sounding melody just about saves the second half from complete mediocrity. the rest is just padding. ok computer is yet another case where contextual significance gets confused with quality.,0
it is really pretentious which i find unbearable most of the time but it has a good variety of songs and you will probably like at least one of them.,0
radiohead has been one of the biggest rock bands of the past thirty years and has been instrumental in shaping modern pop music as a whole. their career began with a single hit creep a catchy little song about loneliness and isolation and its accompanying album pablo honey an alright collection of assorted alt-rock and grunge songs. however between this album and the release of their next album something happened. thom yorke fancied himself the tortured artist who was not content with fame whose profound statements on society and culture which were on the level of high school emo poetry written in the back pages of a discarded notebook needed to be heard by everyone. his new-found sense of self-importance and self-pity led to the bends a mediocre album that basically sanitized any sense of self-awareness and edginess that the alt-rock at the time had in exchange for a bland wash of nonsense. still there were some good songs here and there such as my iron lung that resembled their original catchiness. and then came this album. when any band starts with something like pablo honey and ends up here they are often compared to a band like the beatles. however the beatles songwriting capabilities were always stellar and their later music was actually experimental and innovative for the time. ok computer is devoid of any real experimentation and innovation recycling old styles in and meshing them into once again a bland wash of nonsense without any real emotional potency. this just seems like an attempt to become something more than the sum of their parts. thom yorke is even more annoying on this release as well. he retains this whiny and clingy vocal strain the average circle-jerking hipster would refer to as ethereal and isolated but is devoid of true intent and emotional potency sounding like some ironic rebuttal rather than a genuine problem. i could potentially look past this if his tendency to compose a jumble of egotistical and pretentious lyrics that truly sound like an angsty teenagers diary was not so ear-splitting. fitter happier is a perfect example of this. a robotic voice lists off a bunch of problems that thom yorke lists with society as he yearns to return to a more earnest time. why does not he sing this with his own voice? is it an attempt to be clever by making a robot list off things that society requires to make it sound automated? yes. but it sounds like a teenager saying no repeatedly and making an ironic agreement with whatever somebody is saying to them without actually bringing up a concrete reason as to why it is a problem. this sort of cringy discontent with society is apparent throughout the album such as in let down and subterranean homesick alien. other tracks are slightly more subtle in their lyricism and have a little more depth and deal with personal issues but thom yorkes lackadaisical and rather dull voice put me to sleep. while that may be the point that point does not make for good singing or music. speaking of the music the music as previously stated is a bland mix of other styles in an attempt to create something new. most of the songs are castrations of alt-rock music to make the music sound more dejected. they are all something we have heard before but worse. there is nothing remotely innovative on this album. the songs that do veer from this formula often fall flat on their face. airbag while one of the better cuts lyrically and instrumentally sounds like if the smiths and portishead made a song together but without the beautiful instrumental mystery and intrigue of portishead a lot of what radiohead was doing aesthetically with their music was done better by portishead. it is just a basic trip hop beat with reverb-washed jangly guitars. great. fitter happier sounds like the beginning of an aphex twin outtake with its ominous pianos and electronic sound effects but without the musical complexity or intrigue of aphex twin. however on a positive note some of these instrumental tracks are the highpoints of the album. paranoid android the best song on the whole album is musically captivating in its journey from catchy acoustic melody to complex proghard rock to dirge and back to hard rock. and the lyrics are actually not cringe-inducing. cimbing up the walls also does not have cringe-inducing lyrics and sounds rather cryptic in its message and the fuzzed-out guitar and violin combination throughout and the dissonance at the end are captivating. the song still suffers from thom yorkes incessant moaning. this album in my opinion is a low-point in a good bands career. it is like the red-headed step-child in my opinion but most people consider it to be the perfect all as all-american student-athlete. it lacks the catchiness of their early work but lacks the experimental and cryptic tendencies of their later work like kid a and amnesiac which are their two best albums in my opinion or the emotional resonance of a moon-shaped pool. it is overrated and does not deserve the praise it gets.,0
you know for as long as i have actively listened researched and sought out music almost ninety-five percent of that music good or bad has made me feel some sort of emotion it made me laugh it made me cry it made me want to throw something heavy through a window lots of it gave me an adrenaline rush a majority has amplified my brooding nature. this is a huge part of what i believe is and is not good music an emotional response of course along with a catchy hook and some interesting songwriting. the worst thing a band could possibly do is trigger little to no emotional reaction from me. even really shitty artists can get something from me taylor swift makes me frustrated at her antics and ego cardi b makes me angry and i want to throw something at her deicide makes me laugh because of how eyerollingly stupid the themes of fake satanism are. those are just a few examples but they all share that same trait. however as i said the worst thing a band could do is not give me any reason to emotionally invest myself in the music. if it leave me with nothing than it is an automatic failure songwriting and catchy hooks be damned. ok computer unfortunately has fallen into this whole and so has the rest of radiohead. i have given this band too many chances and they wasted them all. the issue was present even before i listened to this band. everyone kept saying to me listen to radiohead. or hey dude have you heard of radiohead? and i am like yes i have heard of them. i was going to listen to them but i am lazy and i kept forgetting it got to a point where i did not forget and i just did not want to do because i kept getting the same response when ever i even uttered the name. i did not want to talk about radiohead and so i did not. until i joined rym. now here i am sitting here writing review and talking about it. recently i have gotten a couple of comments from people complaining about the ratings i have for their first three albums all of which are now deleted because i are not having that shit. and my train of though lead me here. to this bands page writing about how much of a bore this band is. and what a bore they are i will stand by that statement until my ashes are thrown to the wind. those comments made me listen to the album one last time to see if i did somehow change my mind. spoiler alert i did not. this album is bloated uninteresting and leaves me with squat. yorke is whiny as fuck and i do not care the atmosphere is bland at the very best it is the average mans 90s music. nothing special at all and i partially blame the fan base for hyping it up far too much it reduces the appreciation quality by like ten percent each time. and people say this is art rock? i am not seeing much art here if i did not know any better i would think this is just another u2 album. it is that unmemorable. however at the end of the day music is music and it is all based on subjectivity so if you like this album if you like radiohead i do not hate you. you are not a bad person for liking this and maybe there is something wrong with me i do not know. what i do know is that a lot of people like ok computer and i am fine with that i am just not in those numbers and if you try to convert me again i am going to gather as many copies of okay computer and burn them all. this is not a bad band i am just tired of them.,0
not an album that holds much appeal to me anymore but i can recognise its merits. radiohead hugely expand their sound palette here to make a uniquely moody and atmospheric album. they do some more interesting things here than on the straightforward rocky the bends but it took adding electronic instruments and krautrock rhythms to their repertoire for them to become truly aesthetically interesting to me.,0
so i just noticed that this is the highest ranked thing on the website and decided to put this obscure alternative band into the spotify. so how is it? well this thing is basically noisy ambient music. as it lacks real riffs or melody so they go for the texture of the sound. however in my book to sustain a song of 4 minutes you need more than texture if your songs are going to be so noisy. otherwise you should go full ambient instead of putting some guitar playing in the middle. although the vocalist sounds so sleepy with his talking i would not call this singning to make me sleep which is a plus. it is better than the last tool album but i would not rate it as anything above average.,0
      .            .         .  .  .                ok computer     .  talking heads . it was really painfull for me to get through this album. 50 minutes of bland? boring elevator music. oh god i will never understand why people like this album and band so much. it is just a blank space for me. i will better go and listen talking heads or rhcp or placebo aka real music.,0
could this be the most overrated album of all time? i could make a good argument that it is. after all it is ryms number one-rated album. to me it is too stuck in radioheads britpop thing to be really noteworthy. when the band cast that aside they finally were able to eclipse europe and take on the world. it is an album that i generally enjoy listening to but i get a bit bored after a while. paranoid android does not seem nearly as interesting to me as everyone thinks it is.,0
this album is a mixture of classic tunes some of the best ever created with a few moments of filler. exit music climbing up the walls lucky  this is peak radiohead the sound of a legendary band firing on all cylinders. airbag subterranean the tourist  not so much. after hearing the album dozens of times i still cannot remember what the tourist sounds like. the only bad track is fitter happier. first couple of listens forgettable. after a dozen listens irritating. ultimately i feel that this is a great album with a bunch of unforgettable songs but a few lulls keep it from living up to the hype for me.,0
ok computer is an album that for me is actually less than the sum of its parts. what do i mean by that? well there are four songs that i think are excellent paranoid android karma police electioneering and no surprises. i also enjoy fitter happier and climbing up the walls is alright. but the rest is some of the least interesting and most tepid rock music to ever be soaked in by my ears. so if i listen to this album i long for the six songs i actually i like and sitting through the rest makes for a rather boring experience. if those same not-so-great songs were on an album with also meh songs maybe i would enjoy it more. oh well. 5.510,0
believe me i have tried with this record. i have tried so hard. i have listened in depth multiple times trying to figure out why this record is rated so high. i cannot. i really cannot. therefore my review will be simple. karma police is a good song.,0
i had heard this album long before i discovered this website and i was genuinely baffled to see this is the number one album. i assumed it was a popular enough album hence why i tried it out to begin with but not this popular. my initial impression with this album is that apart from kind of liking first two tracks the rest of it bored me. nowadays i do not quite dislike it as i used to but it has not grown on me say the way joy division has joy division i was not massive on when i first heard them and i have grown to love them but radiohead on the other hand i largely still do not get much enjoyment out of their discography. i do like this more now but i still do not get why its such a highly regarded album when i find it to be a kind of mixed bag overall. i still really enjoy the first two tracks but it the rest of it varies for me. subterranean is decent the kind of mysterious eerie sound is pretty good i guess. exit music on the other hand is a dreadfully dull song too long and meandering. let down is a decent ballady song with a catchy hook also i can say i like no surprises karma police and electioneering. electioneering is a welcome throwback to the good bends album. there is also an annoying 2 minute robot interlude because reasons. the rest of it is not bad but just does little for me. at the end of the day this is an ok album which is kind of interesting in what it does with the alternative rock thing and a few good songs but nothing exceptional except perhaps airbag which is an amazing eerie opener and i wish the rest of the album when for that kind of sound. i have never been massive on thom yorkes vocals and its the next album where i find it to be even more grating but here i can overlook it in places because there is fair amount of good riffs and interesting sounds though not enough for me overall.,0
to be perfectly clear radiohead is the single most overrated band i have heard in my life in my opinion. if there was not so much hype around it i feel like i might have been able to just ignore them. dull lyrics that explore dull and played out topics drowned out and barely understandable vocals instrumentals that are really only lightly experimental and a little bit above average in terms of how pleasant they are these things hold back the band a lot on all their albums. while not all are present in full force here it is still enough to make it barely good. overall the album is very mediocre goes nowhere and fast and is hardy the patron saint of music everyone says it is. it is a high quality album i give it that but a high quality version of pretentious uninspired alt-rock is still pretentious uninspired alt-rock.,0
nb my score relates only to notok bonus disc not the original album which is obviously a classic although overrated. what the fuck are these bonus cuts? this is the most uninspired collection of radiohead songs ever released not a single one good or remarkable track on the whole cd. seriously i have never been radiohead fan that much to check out their b-sides and all but i was shocked at how poor and bland these recordings are. plus the sound and production of these songs has almost nothing to do with ok computer they are simply not even remotely in the same vein. these should not have been released at all i am going to.,0
radiohead is a shitwagon of retread good music. ok computer is no exception. there are plenty of albums by plenty of musicians before radiohead that accomplish and often to a better degree what radiohead seeks to accomplish. the music itself is simple emotionally oversaturated but with very little real substance. if radiohead existed in a subterfuge of a musicless hellscape their music would still sound contrived and insincere.,0
this album to me sounds like musical door paint. i cannot think of anything i remember from this album. all i can say is that it is music. again i am happy to know that so many people enjoy this but i am not one of them sorry ,0
first they need to actually sit down and write a song. then they need to make sure that it is a song and not word salad. then they need to set it to music that is not hammered out using the demo tunes from a casiotone with equal input from all 8 members. oh and once that is done they need to learn the piece. and then they can record something of quality which is not this song. also they have not done anything for two years.,0
it is odd from us perspective to understand the draw of this album the avalanches of praise heaped on it is production-as-an-instrument approach and accolades for eclipsing every musical expression since the dawn of mankind with its orchestral space-prog collage. pretty remarkable considering they do not even play it on classic rock radio. the bands true strength is yorkes voice and the cuts that push this remarkable mechanism to center stage dominate the proceedings. the minimalist naked guitar of exit music for a film focuses the listener on his achingly elegant vocal gloom as the din of organs drums and other sounds swell and vanish in the background. karma police also takes full advantage of yorkes soaring despair as simple piano lines swell to a grand clamor in a style reminiscent of bowies space oddity. the full sound of the band is best realized in the wounded shuffling din of climbing up the walls bombastic orchestral racket ebbing and flowing as the song trudges to conclusion. it is not all great the basslines and some of yorkes vocal tendencies cannot seem to shake the ghost of a bad u2 imitation. lucky has the potential to be the most harrowing guitar-driven rock songs in decades like a britpop take on no quarter if it were not for a crappy chorus that drops all tension and back-built momentum like a broken elevator. it is an interesting record sonically ambitious for the time period with great vocals and several strong songs but despite what you have heard it will not cure your cancer.,0
i guess i will never understand the phenomena behind this album being ryms 1. it is the first time for me to listen to radiohead and well... there is nothing original about it no inventiveness whatsoever. none of the tracks suit me at least a bit. it is lacking so many things to be a good album - from lack of energy to weird chaotic music writing. where is the thing people see or hear in this record? beauty? anything memorable? vocals are average music is...at least average. someone said that it at least is not annoying and i get behind that. i feel that that is the first that much overrated album i had chance to listen to and i hope it will remain the last one.,0
chciabym da wicej tej pycie lecz to by si nie zgadzao z moimi przekonaniami wzgldem najlepiej ocenianej produkcji muzycznej na rym. przebrnwszy przez ni po raz drugi mam dalej takie same spostrzeenia jak za pierwszym razem. przede wszystkim brak cigoci linearnej wzgldem caego albumu. piosenki s porozrzucane klimatycznie oraz zbyt krtkie aby nacieszy si przodujc melancholi. jedynie w ostatnich trzech utworach udaje si to uczyni lecz to i tak nie jest szczyt muzykalnoci. lekkie rozczarowanie. 6.510,0
it is enjoyable to say the least but yorkes strange voice and piss poor lyrics ruin it for me.,0
what can i say? the most overrated album in history of rock music. my ears are still bleeding from it... this is better album than zeppelin iv or dark side of the moon or revolver from the beatles etcetcetc... in what universe?,0
       .      .                  .             .                led zeppelin  king crimson      .                     .                          .,0
ok ... computer. how should i write this review? thom yorke sounds like a psychopath in some of these songs. some of them were decent the more quiet ones. avoid the shortest track fitter happier it is definitely an album filler. i am surprised but not surprised on how popular this album is. i do not considered the band of radiohead to have much talent let us just say that. most of the time when yorke sings i think it sounds awful. for this review i actually looked up the lyrics and they were awful too. they were obviously spouting liberal propaganda in a more subtle way i go forward while you go backward and we meet somehow. the last three tracks of this lp is stronger than the first nine except for the exception of let down which is probably the best song on this whole thing. also i can definitely see where blur got their influence on their 13 album released two years later.,0
i have finally listened to this album with full attention. one of those things i wanted to do for a long time. i felt like i would like this album. and i do - it is nicely emotional. but and i should have suspected that just as well it is also veeeeeeeeery repetitive. pair these two things and you get an album that... what is that word... hmm... ah yes... bores me!!!!!!!!!!!! so only 2 from me. done with this.,0
perhaps my third attempt to jam this album into my psyche happens to coincide with having seen the group live at glastonbury 17. the performance which consisted of all of this album was considered a bit of a drag and i remember thinking yes. finally we are on the same page radiohead are a bit of a whiny drag. however - returning to the record afterward the whole encounter has actually managed to chip away some of the mystique for me and i am now comfortable acknowledging the good bits the hits the nicely jagged electioneering and ignoring the bad bits all the whining dragness that shitty robot track. i am not going to own it and listen to it regularly but i have come some way to seeing it in a stable context rather than through my own prejudices.,0
these days i flip-flop with my feelings about this album but like everybody you will ever see on this site it does mean plenty to me and my memory. the feeling of paranoia is pretty spot-on in a lot of areas the ending of karma police and its gradual sense of a darkness creeping up on you the whole of climbing up the walls and in others it is quite arsey fitter happier is not one of the best demonstrations of it here i feel.... but you got to contextualise it all for sure. this would have felt powerful as fuck back then - the narrator notices how oppressive and draining capitalism is that there is no choice but to commit to it in order to survive and that no people with authority are truly willing to sympathise and help because authority comes with abuseable power and complacency with the way that things are these observations are ones that every person goes through especially at the age that most get into radiohead anyways coinciding with a time when most crave a new emotional and conceptual pulse in alternative music hence its consistent connection to every generation of kids who see radiohead as the people at the forefront of boundary-pushing music. you can argue all day about the details of that but the fact is that folks like i still swoon at the thought of the chorus of lucky and that the tenderness of no surprises in light of its suffocating seriously sad and suicidal subject matter hits a unique emotional place. i am less interested in the specificity of the whole navigating the digital world concept and instead i appreciate the instances that thom yorke applies these feelings of paranoia to - the fear of the cars airbag failing to save him from a crash airbag the skin-crawling sense that somebody is eyes are watching you climbing up the walls imposter syndrome subt. homesick alien. and yet still there are brief moments of euphoria like epiphanies where it all falls into place. the times when the album is fully submerged in stagnant pessimism are when it feels shallow not solely because of the pessimism but because there is no light to contrast the dark and those moments of contradiction create radioheads smartest songs honestly. i am not sure i listen to ok computer very often anymore but the creative decisions on it are fairly out-there so it is quite a neat album for so many people to have as a starting point into alternative music.,0
not bad by any means... but in an alternative universe where any of these tracks would have ended up on the original release ok computer could have become a worse album and maybe not as appreciated as it is today. most of these tracks just sound generic compared to any ok computer song. not that they are bad just your usual 90s alt. rock stuff which could be seen as a bad thing in itself. still would probably recommend it if you love ok computer and if you like your 90s radiohead with thoms voice at its stongest and johnnys guitar at its showiest. even though some of these cuts end up feeling way more like ambient music than they should.,0
radiohead fans are known snobs they do not know anything about music because the only music they listen to is radiohead. that is just one of many reasons why i feel distant from anything the band tries to conceive. pseudo fervency and spuriousness never seemed to help one. this succeeds on a grizzlying scale of greed and gluttony as if ok computer is about to devour the whole world after twenty years later. not ok.,0
everyone is favorite band with the possible exception of me since about 1998 or so. this their magnum opus is the best thing they have ever done. i still do not think much of it. lots of alternate tunings and moody brian eno-lifted soundscapes with thom yorke alternately sighing andor howling over it. what exactly is the appeal of this? this is their best record by far i have heard them all ad infinitum from enthusiastic friends and acquaintances and i can suss out three decent songs and only a small number of good melodies. the rest substitutes an unconventionally tuned guitar and repetitive riff along with spooky noise and yorkes wails in the place where most actually great bands usually put those things we call songs. where are the songs here? this begat shit like coldplay or radiohead for people without problems as i like to call them and i hold them responsible. it is just tedious. highest rated album on this website. ever! what a world.,0
my friend was showing me this album and telling me how amazing it is. i personally think this album is that incredible. i guess the style just was not my thing. i liked it but it was not amazing. i liked subterranean homesick alien climbing up the walls no surprises and the tourist. it took me a while to get into the album and i really never got sucked into the album sadly i disagree with rym i do not really think it was that amazing. i think it was highly above average.,0
straddles the line between being lyrically vague enough to convince the people who grew up on it that it is super deep dude while thematically on-the-nose enough to be obnoxious and resonate with the types of people who call everyone else sheep. the albums everyone is like a cubicle robot-esque subtext that is summarized on tracks like fitter happier made me realize that this album just was not for me. i probably would have loved it about 4 years ago though. for an album that was intended to be daring i felt it played it too safe and everything starts to feel the same about halfway in especially thom yorkes singing which is the worst offender of this whole album. he sounds like a cat being strangled with piano wire at times and it gets headache-inducing real quick. on an album that is supposed to be experimental and self-aware i wish he would not take himself so seriously with these brooding dramatic vocals. probably the strongest contributor to my low rating of this album. did not like it. on the other hand paranoid android is a great fucking song and it is been stuck in my head for a while now.,0
artistic aspritations can be either a blessing or a curse. sometimes they can be both. employing such topics as transportation both inter- and intraplanetary cruelty towards animals and insects and the encroaching technobureaucracy ok computer explores the effect of social control on the human mind - all while blurring the lines between rock song and film score. a very welcome reprieve from the mundanity of most commercial rock music. unfortunately the members of radiohead seem to have as much anxiety about their own instrumental competence as they have about everything else. as a result they let every idea on this album get bogged down by studio ornamentation keeping the whole thing from meeting its appointed potential - that is as one of rock musics greatest antiseptics.,0
what could really be said about this album? almost too much at this point. my criteria for rating albums is actually rather simple so i try to ignore as much of the hysteria good and bad surrounding an album like this. this album generally has beautiful songs with beautiful and lush production. this album also possesses a strange sort of cohesiveness that is unusual developing as a kind of cohesive story from the general alienation in the first half to the surreal and metaphysical ballads after electioneering. verdict 710 good will give a listen on occasion 3.5 stars,0
difficult to listen to and not relevant if you are not depressed in some way. there is a heavy handed message of the world around you is an evil place that is meant to kick you down without mercy. this is taken to such a degree that it reaches the point of being pathetic. truly the easiest thing one can do is blame the world instead of themselves! outside of this the actual musical content ranges from good to amazing. the songs are enveloping and loud and very detailed throughout. there is so much information being transmitted and the loud textured noise leaves such a massive footprint that one cannot help but feel exhausted after listening to the entire thing. while this is a classic i would not recommend it to anyone who is not flat out depressed. it will not have much of an impact on you. as stated previously the music is good but it is not like there are not other albums that do a similar thing and better. 35,0
there is nothing bad with pretentious art as long as the artist fulfill his pretension. ok computer deserves bombastic crowns it is universal it is futuristic it is well made to it is smallest details but it is music and lyrics are rarely reach the high standards that the themes deserves. the main theme of the album is the sci-fi motive of cyborg the human-computer combination which is the theme of some of the best popular records like laurie andersons big science and kraftwerks computer world and the man machine. here the man-machine oxymoron is mostly expressed with the dialog between warm rock ensemble lead by jonny greenwoods guitar and electronic instruments pads and effects. the combination is often tiring with too dominant guitar and unoriginal use of the effects like the stupid vocoder in fitter-happier with it is formulary text and the annoying whining guitar parts and solos in lucky and in climbing up the walls. sometimes it works especially in the less heavy tracks of the album when the guitar is less taking-over and the electronic parts are based on quiet pads or small touches followed by smooth keyboards like in beautiful let down classic karma police and worn yet touching no surprises and paranoid android in which the acoustic guitar takes the part of the keyboard. theses tunes express perfectly the melancholy alienated feeling that the suicidal cliches in the lyrics of exit music for instance fail to reach. the lyrics of the album however are rarely understood because of thom yorkes floating-spreading singing that a whole generation of rockers tried to duplicate in a despair attempt to reach rym top 100. the album contains one pearl that stands in the front of radiohead resume. airbag is based on an amazing drum riff that in a way is opposite to the beat of the melody especially the thrilling tremolo guitar verse and thom yorkes slow melody. this conflict is radiohead secret weapon. it makes radioheads best songs masterpieces especially some of the songs in kid a king of limbs and in rainbows. the tremolo makes the song the riff is brilliant the solo and the effects are fantastic and the whole song is a display of greenwood at his top. the lyrics are only a cover sub-text-less and direct declarations that express the yearning for a new birth an interstellar burst as a mechanic person. the music is filled with passion for renewal and express perfectly not only the pre millennium atmosphere but radioheads rebirth as a post-britpop electronic ensemble. radiohead has surely designed the sound of the new decade but two months after the release of ok computer a new album has released a perfect masterpiece that represented far more innovative combination of electronic and non-electronic music homogenic by bjork.,0
i get the love and acclaim for this album. the mixing and the arrangements the violins on climbing up the walls! are gorgeous and lambent exemplifying a level of attentiveness that must have felt like a breath of fresh air in the late 90s. but like so many with progressive tendencies they forget that craftsmanship and technical mastery are not everything. thom yorkes lyrical melodrama is among the most lacking in this regard running the gamut from the hamfisted as on fitter happer to the laughable  is the idea of yuppies networking really so horrifying as to necessitate his yelps of despair? to be sure bleakness and alienation come part and parcel with postmodernity but yorke and the boys never quite evoke any such feelings instead settling for a vague gesturing that leaves me unmoved. maybe i am just not in on the joke and the overall tepidness of the album is supposed to symbolize the overall tepidness of the post-industrial first world. if that is irony there is no joy to it  and why should i care about that? c,0
quick intake of breath...ok here goes i am going to take on the behemoth rate your musics number one album the much loved much discussed ok computer apparently not only radioheads finest album but considered one of the greatest albums of all time. first off i have lived with ok computer since it is release way back in the nineties i was the perfect age for radiohead 26 years of age a musician and songwriter and already a fan of the band thanks to creep and previous album the bends so why is it i have always had something of a lukewarm relationship with the bands most acclaimed work maybe it is a little too close to progressive rock a genre i have never loved completely in it is sound design and reach sure the songs are for the most part much more focused and melodic than those i usually find in most prog but the production definitely has the feel of say pink floyd for quite a while i felt that this was my one bug bear with ok computer for an album that seems to be wanting to draw me in with it is emotional pull it is awfully cold and calculated and dare i say it a little overblown. yet as i have lived the last 20 years with ok computer i have grown to realize that my main gripe with ok computer is not really the suffocating production rather it is the quality of the songwriting on show. it is easy to see why ok computer is so loved it is beautifully sequenced and musically it is nigh on perfect unlike most of those prog bands radiohead very rarely stray off into pointless interludes that serve only to show us their musical abilities always serving the song perfectly. the guitars in particular always seem to hit the right note find the right texture and colour these songs in a way few other bands are able to. i just wish the songs were less inconsistent and that the album had more tone than the grey that seems to strangle it from first note to last almost every song here is mid to slow tempo and coupled with yorkes nasally whine can get a little hard to get through the run from subterranean homesick alien through to electioneering is pretty tough going for me the last song is the only genuine rocker on the whole record but it sounds like filler to these ears the verses do not engage me and that chorus is a damp squib. in between we get a spoken word piece called fitter happier that gets irritating about 30 seconds in exit music for a film aims for devastating melancholy but comes across like self absorbed whining let down is even mopier and subterranean homesick alien is just plain dull with perhaps the albums worst chorus. which leaves the excellent karma police easily one of the albums best tracks like opener airbag it has a menacing slightly unhinged feel to it that suits the band much better than the wallowing in misery found elsewhere however both tracks are nearly ruined by the bands artistry and refusal to finish a song without a hail of feedback andor sound effects they do this at least half a dozen times on this album and i am bored already by the second time they do it. paranoid android is rightly hailed as one of the albums high points it contains everything great about radiohead it is a complex piece of many segments that never seems unfocused every part perfectly woven together melodically and lyrically perfect i think it is the highlight of their career singles wise and remains one of my favourite singles of all time for a song this challenging this intelligent to top the uk singles chart still fills me with joy. and i really like the albums run in climbing up the walls is nearly ruined by another annoyingly pointless end and the tourist gets dangerously close to overblown 70s rock histrionics in it is close out although that ping is cool it has to be said but the former mixes a bit of a portishead massive attack and tricky vibe to great effect whilst the latter has one of the albums best melody lines. and there is nothing at all wrong with either the utterly gorgeous no surprises which contains the albums prettiest melody or the neil youngcrazy horse like lucky. there is absolutely no doubting radioheads talent or grasp of melody and ok computer has these traits writ large all over it but this is the number one album on rate your music and i feel the mid section of the album is a bit of a slog and less than perfect from a songwriting perspective hence my above average rating. still it is well better than most classic albums out there.,0
it probably is as innovative as its fans claim. whatever does not make it interesting listening. most of the songs are just boring. i used to find fitter happier amusing but it just irritates me now. consumerism as a subject for serious social commentary is played out and this track brings nothing new or interesting to the table. there are a few really good songs though. if i believed in measuring albums by averaging how good all the songs are i would rate it higher. but having one fantastic song and twelve mediocre songs does not make a good album. the good song is good independently. but ok computers good songs let down and no surprises are wonderful ballads the lyrics i think are a little disappointing for they eschew timeless universal themes in favour of the overall albums eventually-to-be-dated commentary on the modern industrial world. but then again if i want to listen to poetry i will buy a spoken-word album and electioneering is stomping exhilarating bluesy number. unlike the ballads the lyrics are very fitting it is an effective piece about the political situation and lends itself much better to universal application. but the music is the most important thing and this song shows that radiohead were capable of cutting the whinging and just rocking. in short ok computer is not a good album but it does have some very good songs which do justify the albums existence.,0
radiohead found lightning in a bottle with the morose and ambivalent ok computer. the band has managed to take the alienation of modern city life and condense its massive frustrations into an approachable but musically engaging alt rock album. the setup is surprisingly conventional. the band is still using the three guitar approach from their last album while expanding their sound with tasteful electronics. the guitar work and solos are all around excellent complimenting the albums signature melancholy. the interesting points of departure come in radioheads exceptional knack for melodies and thom yorkes largely crooned vocalwork. he delivers on the albums signature angst by soaring above and around the bands playing. a lot of his vocals drive the emotional core of the project but i think its crowning jewel lies in the lyrics. the lyrics are a series of jagged details colliding together into semi coherent laments. while this may sound like a complaint i think it is one of the albums best assets. the words make sense as pathos for a divided world where people are increasingly isolated from each other and the greatest issues in life are forces far beyond the control of any one person. the protagonists of ok computer are incapable of functioning as basic humans and are entirely unable to fix themselves. these anxieties are general enough to empathize with an enormous amount of personal issues providing theming general enough to apply to many but specific enough to never lose its weight. i think this dynamic is part of why ok computer enjoys such unanimous acclaim while being surprisingly difficult to pin down. the arrangements give thom yorkes poetry direction while yorkes lyrics contextualize the musics incredible melodramas. they feed in and out of each other perfectly. the only hesitation i have with ok computer is its fluff. exit music and electioneering do not serve the albums larger conceptual thesis or clash against the central tone respectively. these songs could have been cut but i understand that studio politics kept them in the track list. they are not enormous blemishes but i would rather listen to them as singles. i also understand that some find the presentation to be sterile compared to their later work. i can see how this album is tame compared to gut wrenchers like hole in the heart or their followup release kid a but i think that the approachability of alt rock was not only a sincere creative choice but the right one to make. in an age where so many have lost control of their fate it makes sense this album would be the 1 album on rym.,0

jesus christ shut up about this god damn album please. over and over i am told that this is the purest articulation of the ennui of postmodern society on a par with the likes of seargeant peppers and unknown pleasures in terms of cultural impact and artistry. the alt-rock bible they tell me. i feel like buster keaton in the wind trying to brave the sheer amount of hype this album seems to generate. is it a crime that i think this album is ok but just that. nothing about this album gets me particularly excited. i do not think it does anything interesting in terms of song-structure. i think the things that it has to say about society and consumer culture are self-evident and have aged like milk in the same way that fight club aged like milk fitter happier is embarrasing these days my god. so thom yorke and co. read some william gibson and some fredric jameson they were not the first in the music industry to do so. i do think it is a competent indie-rock album. but being competent should not be something you praise. i could use another word bland. ok computer is bland it has one or two songs i do enjoy but for the most part everything fades into a kind of vague guitar mush and my eyes glaze over and i am reminded of the songs i used to play on my guitar when i was younger because they were songs you learnt. i hate that this has become the standard. when people tell me this is their favorite album i always think great job you have fulfilled the requirement to have an interest in music now could you give me a spicier opinion please or are you just going to regurgitate classic albums at me all night. i do not articulate this i usually tell them to listen to modest mouses two first albums and then slowdive and some other suitably harrowing shit depending on what type of person they are and then go about my way. there is no reason for this to get so much praise for god sakes this is the bends 2. i am docking it half a star because this is the album that persuaded pavement to let nigel godrich do mixing on their last album.,0
have you ever noticed how this band always release their albums in really good years for music? maybe they liked the challenge. anyway this is a review i have tried many times to write but not many of them have been anything other than drafts. i do not feel as strongly about this album any more so i am hoping that reviewing it will be easier this time. first of all radiohead is an overrated band because of how consistently their albums are good or better  all of their music except perhaps for the king of limbs is at quite a high standard and thus people revere them. in my opinion as someone who is not especially partial to in rainbows or the bends and someone who is bound to be disagreed with the problem is that only a couple of their albums are downright brilliant like everyone seems to think  ok computer is just barely one of them among their best records and a record that contains four of their best songs subterranean homesick alien is probably up there in their top three  i would also include house of cards and morning bell  what can i say philip selway is my favourite member of the band  throughout the second half of the bands discography he has delivered some of the best percussion of the 2000s house of cards features the prettiest drumming i have heard since ringo on in my life. that said it is only recently that i have come around to his work here. admittedly he would reach his peak on kid a but i am still a sucker for some of his work on ok computer subterranean homesick alien being no exception  it is not the most unique bit of percussion in the world but the weird revolving feeling it has is really a clever feat of production. thom yorkes vocals are beautiful here as are his lyrics i wish that they would swoop down in a country lanelate at night when i am drivingtake me on board their beautiful shipshow me the world as i would love to see iti would tell all my friendsbut they would never believe methey would think that i would finally lost it completely  the way he sings lost it completely is more telling than the line itself. let down is one of the most heartbreaking songs i can think of. its riff despite not being the most technically proficient guitar work on the album is absolutely beautiful but the song mainly exists for its vocals which get sublime in the last third of the song wherein yorke throws some falsetto over the top of the aesthetic the song had maintained until that moment. lyrically it is devastating as the title would suggest the emptiest of feelingsdisappointed people clinging on to bottles one day i am going to grow wingsa chemical reactionhysterical and useless. no surprises is also quite the heartbreaker  it is home to the albums best bassline and a great melody. its best moment is the intensity of yorkes singing such a pretty house and such a pretty garden. the tourist is an underrated track which to me captures the split second between a car accident having happened and you realizing it is happened. as such it is a rather dreamy song but with an edge of the panic that one feels as something bad is inevitably happening soon. the fills selway does are brilliant. the song is also home to the most conventional guitar tones on the album which would fit well in the discography of an early 70s hard rock singles band. do not get me wrong though greenwoods guitarwork is great probably at its best on the album. on the other hand though my favourite thing about this record is how clever and well thought out all the tones of all the instruments are here. it is not an experimental rock album but the band really took things into their own hands as far as the sounds of the guitars and keyboards which are varied unpredictable and key to the identity of each song. the production is brilliant in other respects too like the occasional creepy additions of background noise that you will hear in fitter happier and exit music for a film. the thing about using unusual tones is that it is bound to be divisive. in the case of ok computer most people seem to have fallen head over heels with the sound palette but i find that half the time the guitars come off as sounding slightly bland even though the songwriting and playing is always great. put it this way it is a hard album to deny the brilliance of. i would go as far as saying that no album has captured the inherent coldness and isolation of the modern world nearly as well as this one it even does the job better than radioheads followup kid a an album i prefer. but i still fill comfortable deferring to limedibagels calling this album the best of 1997 is accurate although modest mouses offering that year is a definite contender. calling this album the best of the 90s is perfectly reasonable. calling this album the best of all time is embarrassing. scrolling up and downi am born again.,0
my first encounter with radiohead was sometime when i was taking my first baby steps into the world of music new to the exciting spotify program and constantly browsing around for new good songs to listen to. i came across creep which seems to be their most well-known song for some incredibly odd reason and i also came across karma police which i enjoyed a bit more. however at the time i was not a huge fan of radiohead and for years to come i would still find their music to be incredibly overhyped by the general population. i still to this day do not find much interesting about the band. maybe this is from my days as a hardcore muse-fan maybe it is from having outgrown brittish alt-rock by the time i actually started listening to their records or maybe their music just is not for me. ok computer exists as the bridging gap between the more accessible mainstream radiohead the one behind the more popular singles creep high and dry and despite being seen as quite ordinary it still adventures a bit beyond the more straightforward rock music of the late 90s with electronic elements peeking in and out hinting of the direction to come on kid a three years into the future something especially notable during the ending segment of airbag or the choir that comes in right in the middle of exit music for a film. however despite all these attempts i find it hard to find something to hold onto that is not prevalent in most alt-rock bands from the same time and place. there is something about radioheads music from before kid a that sounds so dumbed down and simplistic where the only thing that really seperates radiohead from your run of the mill late 90s rock band is thom yorkes poetic lyrics a handshake of carbon monoxide the unnecessary experimentation with tracks like fitter happier and the raw emotion that seeps through on a couple of tracks here and there namely let down and no surprises on this record. it took me years to go from not being a fan at all to being able to atleast somewhat appreciate ok computer on a personal level and i doubt i will ever be able to love it or radiohead as much as some people think they deserve. for me radiohead is the band that will be our generations pink floyd the modern kind of dad-rock albums that kids will come across through parents who never ventured outside of the swamps of nmes favorite bands. but honestly do not mind my ridiculously grumpy opinions. if you have not already heard this album there is a great chance that you might love every second of it and it is honestly worth the fifty minutes it takes to go from airbag to the tourist so if you find yourself on a long commute to work or traveling somewhere far this summer then bring this one and a pair of earbuds for the journey. ok computer radiohead 6.510,0

questo  il classico esempio di album che deve piacere per forza osannato dalla critica come un capolavoro assoluto. in realt analizzandolo dal punto di vista strettamente musicale segna davvero pochi passi positivi se si esclude la onnipresente karma police e la sognante no surprises. il resto  un buon tappeto musicale per carit pu servire da comodo sottofondo musicale se si sta studiando o leggendo ma un ottimo album  tutta unaltra cosa. sarebbe stato pi coerente forse fare una traccia unica e non suddividere le varie canzoni ottenendo leffetto di spezzatino che non giova al genere. in conclusione un album da mostrare ovvero da avere in casa solo per potersi illudere di essere un intenditore musicale dai gusti raffinati quando in realt si fa fatica ad ascoltarlo tutto senza andare avanti con le tracce.,0

going into this review i was already semi-familiar with ok computer. having been a longtime fan of indie music though i am hesitant to use the term indie because it covers such a broad range of music nowadays it was difficult to discuss music without radiohead coming up  and of course ok computer. my first listen of ok computer some two or three years left me feeling pretty unimpressed. the instrumentation only really held my interest on a handful of tracks and the same goes for the lyrics. before i go much further though let me warn you my opinion of this album has not changed all that much. the first three tracks on the album  airbag paranoid android and subterranean homesick alien  are songs that fall into a category of music that i call decent enough. nothing in those three songs jump out at me. the lyrics keep me at a consistent level of disinterest and the instrumentation is just good enough to keep me listening waiting for some sort of crescendo. finally that crescendo comes exit music for a film is one of my favorite songs off of ok computer. not only is the crescendo a little more than 34 of the way through incredible but the lyrics actually give me goosebumps you can laugh  a spineless laugh  we hope your rules and wisdom choke you  now we are one in everlasting peace. allow me to reiterate that i do not think the lyrics in the songs preceding exit music for a film were bad they simply failed to jump out at me. this might have to do with the fact that the instrumentation failed to support the lyrics because i will not deny that the verse in the next world war  in a jackknifed juggernaut  i am born again from airbag is bland it just does not sell itself in the song. let down is a bit of a letdown after exist music for a film though i suppose it would be a bit repetitive to follow a great crescendo of a song with another intense crescendo of a song. still let down falls into that same category as the first three songs on the album decent enough. however there is one part of the song that does manage to jump out at me and the lyrics in that section almost manage to give me goosebumps too one day i am going to grow wings  a chemical reaction  hysterical and useless. karma police is a catchy song and its lyrics are pretty gripping too. my favorite verse is karma police arrest this girl  her hitler hairdo is  making me feel ill  and we have crashed her party. in fact it is from the lyrics in karma police that i first began to draw my conclusions about the lyrical themes in the album. to me ok computer is a collection of songs aimed at exposing and criticizing the ignorance and ridiculous vanity of much of humanity in 1997 and unfortunately the lyrics are still relevant now in 2014. there are also themes of conformity which might fall under vanity. fitter happier is the best example of the themes of conformity found throughout the album as the entire track is just a robotic voice reciting reasons as to whyhow he is fitter and happier. though this song borders on being laughable for how overwrought it is with metaphor the lyrics manage to be intense enough that you have to take it seriously it is a powerful track. however all of the tracks following fitter happier kind of blur together for me with the only that stands out being no surprises. it is a catchy track with a sweet melody and the chorus gets stuck in your head  but those are pretty much the only reasons why it stands out to me. unfortunately electioneering climbing up the walls lucky and the tourist are all just decent enough. the instrumentation is consistently well executed and the lyrics are undeniably poetic and powerful but they just fail to sell themselves. in conclusion i do not believe that a song has to literally sell itself to me with lavishly produced synths fit for the radio or anything but i guess i just expected every aspect of ok computer to be mind blowing. after all it has quite the reputation though it might be that reputation that caused my to set my expectations so high and thus caused me to be overall disappointed. rating 710 favorite tracks exit music for a film karma police fitter happier and no surprises - florist jenkins,0
further implementation of studio tech would finally reveal radioheads musical potential ok computer is pretty much a concept album for the distraught condition of trying to be human in an era where technology is increasingly more prevalent and necessary for us to feel important. the psychedelic overture of airbag implements delicately-placed jingle-bells chiming in the backdrop as well as the synth cello harmonizing the main riff. then the disorienting swaths of digital turntablism just adds to the atmosphere of a world helplessly computerized and technological. the hit of the album paranoid android demonstrates a haunting performance from yorke slurring infantile moans in the verses and a hook of him crooning a melodic and worrisome cry of fear what is this!? what is that!? the track also features some of jonnys most interesting guitar-work going from mellow gilmour-esque rock to hard and distorted grunge. subterranean homesick alien slows down the momentum a bit but exceeds at maintaining the albums cosmic sound and pale despairing mood. jonny contributes some reverberating slides and twinkling licks that float and collapse into mesmerizing mayhem. exit music surprises with an upfront and personal acoustic accompaniment a chamber-pop ditty supplied with a ghostly bloodless back-up choir and the tinny sample of a squeaking railway to effectively create an atmosphere of urban anxiety similar to what pere ubu did in the modern dance. let down alleviates the depression. a glittery riff from jonny and a more uplifting refrain coupled with lyrics about yorkes abstract misery let us the song exist in a state of contradiction -- it hints that sadness and pain is expected and even welcomed. karma police is the most catchy demonstration of yorkes melodic whimpering. a melody very very similar to the beatles martha my dear but this can be excused due to the two songs obviously contrasting tones. fitter happier is the albums disturbing interlude with the monologue of a digital voice either a robot or a dehumanized person beyond a soundscape of studio fluff and other assorted audio effects to enhance the horror and disaffected despair. electioneering offers hard-rock and electric blues reminiscent of blue oyster cult and the power-pop of the bands earlier work. it prevails at sustaining excitement. climbing up the walls is slow and muffled with distortion ending with a psychotic howl. in contrast no surprises features a very pretty melody accompanied with the sweet dings of a glockenspiel. after some writhing verses the overwhelming triumph in the hook of lucky suggests a happy ending for ok computer until you hear the albums tragic and comatose closer the tourist a song of slow-moving rhythm bass and guitar stalling with improvisation at the start for yorke to step in and deliver an unexpectedly serene performance lyrics vaguely about moving fast and seeing sparks which i loosely affiliate with the air crash of the previous song. then after all this meticulous multi-layered production extravagant synth and compositional arrangements emotional performances from yorke on vocals and jonny on guitar how does the album end? ok computer concludes with the last playful ding of a triangle. who says punk is dead.,0

lt 1 one thing i really liked was the clear direction in atmosphere all the way up to track 9. we have the first two tracks making the most of the fact that the direction of the album and the sound on it might not be entirely clear yet before track 3 slows things down to bring context to the anthemic conclusion to the opening act of ok computer that is track 4. now with a clear sound and a good idea of what the atmosphere here is we have tracks 5 through 7 capitalizing on these notions building and sustaining themselves upon the atmosphere of the album. track 7 is also a great conclusion to this part leaving the album on a bit of a cliffhanger as to where to go next and track 8 makes fantastic use of this uncertainty to propel ok computer in a completely new direction thus giving us a set up to a darker final act made great use of by track 9. sadly that is where the string is broken. on the last three tracks i get the impression that the bigger picture was kind of lost track 10 feels especially out of place a very badly timed cheerful song with little else to show for itself. track 11 sounds like it was originally a b-side slapped in to salvage the ending as being part of the rest of the album somewhat and track 12 is another jarring change of pace. of course one can argue that tracks 10 and 12 are meant to be cathartic in a way to serve as a contrast for the darker previous sounds but if that was the purpose then they were just badly executed as such. track 12 is salvaged by the fact that it is a genuinely interesting song but i really cannot say that about track 10 and overall they are way too bubbly and too close together there was also not enough space in between the cliffhanger and track 10 to actually justify such a drastic change of sound. a cathartic track should serve as relief after a gruelling journey not as a bump in the road. other than that the songwriting is pretty solid throughout more playful at the first two tracks more collected during the rest. i am afraid this affects the album negatively on the second half as there is a clear rehashing of ideas with many of the tracks that seems to not accomplish any goal other than taking up space. during the first two it is a lot more inventive allowing for some really interesting progressions of ideas but they ultimately seem a bit underdeveloped with a series of unresolved ideas and dead ends especially prevalent on track 2. the production is probably the best part of the whole ordeal creating a dynamic and spacious sound with some very minor blemishes.,0
je ne comprend pas honntement comment cet album peut se classer 1er toutes annes confondues. cest le pire album dun groupe largement surestim. les mlodies sont dgueulasses. les singles sont les pires. jai mis un point tout de mme pour lucky et son break excellent.,0

there are very few bands out there that have confused me as much as the english alternative rockers radiohead. this is a band that combined rock music with electronica to forge their own niche within the 90s alternative scene. in doing so they have somehow became one of the most celebrated and albeit divisive bands not just on rateyourmusic but in music in general. to be perfectly honest i have never quite understood the insane devotion that radiohead and especially ok computer receives. i have often felt that the music had somewhat of a shallow and clinical tone although i will not deny that they were an innovative group especially when compared with the majority of other 90s alternative bands. while i have warmed to the bands sound considerably in the past year or so but i am still having trouble fathoming the intense love for this album. to be frank ok computer is not even my favourite radiohead record and i have always drifted more towards kid a when looking for the best example of the bands creativity. you may call it redundant in me reviewing such a widely known and discussed record but i want to finally be able to sum up my opinion of this record once and for all assuming i do not suddenly fall in love with the album some way down the line. while this record does feature some electronic arrangements this is still a rock record at heart and it really was not until kid a that these electronic parts became fully realised. it is mainly for this reason that i would pick the latter record over this one. at the end of the day however i do have to respect radiohead for not being afraid to experiment in order to find their own sound. the track airbag kicks off the record this track begins with an oddly harsh distorted guitar riff before launching into a much more subdued passage while i can imagine this transition would potentially come across as a little jarring radiohead actually pull this off in a pretty restrained manner. thom yorkes mellow vocals just reach out of the mix but i often feel that he was fighting for room over the guitars. overall i do like the atmosphere that this song presents especially with the wailing guitars in the background but personally i feel that the song could have developed more especially in the latter portions of the track. when listening i would often find myself checking the time left on the song. one of the biggest hits to come from ok computer is the second track paranoid android. this track weaves through a multitude of different parts and as a result is one of the most attention grabbing on the entire record. while the opening minute feels rather bland the song does start to build in its atmosphere once the chorus arrives with the vocals and the guitar leads in the background really highlighting this atmosphere. the song eventually builds into a much heavier section which unlike on airbag is handled in a more well thought out manner. this section shows the band playing at the highest gear with yorke yelling over the mix and with the lead guitars adding even more power to the song. the penultimate section sees the band going into the incredibly mellow and harrowing tones that they are known for. the vocals in this section actually shine through very clearly in this part and the backing vocals add a great deal of despair to the music. while i would not call myself a huge fan of paranoid android i will admit that it is one of the better examples of the bands ability to craft unique challenging and extremely melancholic music. if i were to pick my favourite track from the record it would have to be the song karma police. this is one of the few moments on the record where i feel like i fully get the sound that radiohead are going for. this track builds into a groove with a chord sequence that really brings forth the harrowing atmosphere that i feel that the band often go for. yorkes vocals feel right at home on this track as he sounds as if he could start crying at any minute. my only slight concern with the track is its lyrics this song is one of the strangest songs from a lyrical standpoint that i have heard in a long time. the song seems to be discussing the idea of karma coming back to the narrator after they reported two individuals to the karma police but the analogies the narrator uses eg buzzes like a fridge hitler hairdo just sound awkward in my honest opinion. overall however this is one of the few tracks on ok computer that i regularly find myself revisiting. a couple of other tracks that do stand out to me would be exit music for a film and let down. both of these tracks have a similar depressing atmosphere but each song presents it in a considerably different manner. the first half of exit music relies on just the acoustic guitar and yorkes vocals which sound especially bleak on this track as if he is simply giving up on life. the song let down has much more of a drive to it and has an almost britpop feel to it and as a result i would say the song does at times slip into the generic side of music to a certain extent. with this being said however the vocal melody has a tone of finality to it which is one of the things that radiohead do succeed in producing. sadly however there are a number of tracks that just do not bring much to the table for me. subterranean homesick alien feels particularly unfocused and empty for me. the song seemingly meanders throughout without really building into anything particularly effective. i would also say that the second half of the record does show a noticeable drop in quality when compared with the first half. the first thing we hear from this half is the utterly pointless fitter happier track. i can appreciate the self improvement theme of the lyrics but there is nothing appealing about hearing this from stephen hawkings voice box at least not on a record. the track climbing up the walls is another slower paced track with another really bland and uninteresting vocal melody. while this song does build to a somewhat intense climax it ultimately feels wasted on such a dull melody. thankfully the song no surprises does save the second half of the album. this track does remind me a little of let down albeit with a more subdued tone. the song does have a similar tone of finality in the vocals and when combined with the subtle xylophone and guitar melodies works very well in creating a particularly haunting atmosphere. the production on here is for the most part very well done. the guitars are particularly bright and i really admire the drum production throughout the record the snare is especially punchy albeit sounding a little out of place on a few of the more mellow tracks. as i mentioned earlier the vocals have a tendency to be rather far back in the mix at times as a result it can be somewhat of a challenge discerning what he is singing. so in conclusion is ok computer a solid record? sure. is it deserving of the number one spot on ryms chart? well that is ultimately up to you but personally i would have to disagree. while the album does boast some fairly innovative bleak and well crafted material a significant portion of the songs just lack a lot of depth or direction. a lot of radiohead fans may just say i do not get this and i would agree with them to a point. however even after revisiting this record on multiple occasions i still do not see the godly reputation it gets. maybe i will come back to the album in ten years time and it will finally click but for now i really cannot give this anything above a 7.,0
i have a sneaking suspicion that if radiohead were film composers instead of a rock band i would probably consistently give them 5s for every album they made. they do an incredible job at creating surreal atmospheres throughout this entire album but i also constantly finding the actual substance of the songs to be....ok.,0
this is the album that is number one on the rym charts. this is the album that has over 26000 ratings at the time of this review. this is the album where nearly half the ratings are 5 stars. this is the album held in the highest esteem by fans of radiohead. this is the album by the best band ever according to my ex-boss. this is the album that must be listened to by all music lovers. this is the album by the band that redefined the very idiom that is modern music. this is the album that may change the way you think about music. this is the album that has two of the greatest songs of all time in paranoid android and karma police. this is the album that is tragically poetic lyrically clever and poignant. this is the album that is the soundtrack of the worlds pain and anguish. this is the album for art-rock lovers whose vocabularies are brimming with superlative descriptors. this is the album i have played several times attempting to find inspiration. this is the album that did not deliver what i was attempting to find. this is the album where the vocals are dispensed in the whineiest manner imaginable. this is the album where thom yorke appears to be suffering for his art. this is the album that just might have been ok without him. this is the album that is mostly devoid of rhythm or melody. this is the album that is overly melancholic and dull. this is the album that has very little that is appealing to me. this is the album that explains why i did not see eye to eye with my ex-boss. this is the album i am happy to have heard but will now ignore forever. this is the album we might disagree on but i could not care less. this is the review that will barely see the light of day as it is quickly buried under a pile of self-congratulatory wank. delete. ok.,0
a well-produced philosophically deep release which touches on public surveillance dissatisfaction with material wealth and other such issues and effectively throws these big messy issues out in the open in a tremendously admirable way. but also a release that aside from remarkably progressive tracks like fitter happier ultimately boils down to an awkward mix of grunge and brit-pop slathered in so many effects and big ideas that it became the new big thing to follow despite being painfully awkward apathetic and bloated.,0
i do not understand how this is considered to be the greatest album of all time. it was interesting but even within radioheads discography i would take kid a over this album. i will definitely be listening to this album multiple times to try to let it sink in deeper as should be done with any album with a sense of artistic integrity.,0
a ja tam nawet lubi t pyt ale macie racje jest zdecydowanie za wysoko ,0
i do not know this is kind of a step down from the bends for me. the music could use a shot in the arm and thom yorkes attempts at sounding world-weary and depressed come off sounding more like he is bored. the album as a whole blends together in this mushy bog of feedback and overly drawn-out syllables. some good melodies though particularly in paranoid android and electioneering and i appreciate the attempt at expanding their sound.,0
radiohead is the example of a band getting some critical acclamation and people jump on the bandwagon and also giving acclamation and it grows to the point where people without a clue about music are rating radiohead a 5 not because they like them but because not doing so would not be cool. call me uncool.,0
this album is often hailed as radioheads masterpiece but i am inclined to disagree. it loses its potency about halfway through starting at the godawful fitter happier and never fully recovers until the tourist. but hey all of the songs before that are actually quite amazing. hell if the first six songs and perhaps the tourist were released on an ep and everything else scrapped ok computer would have likely been one of the best eps of the 90s. anyways let us start on a light note by talking about the first several tracks. this album kicks off with airbag which is probably my favorite song off of this album. it is one of radioheads best upbeat songs and manages to be fairly creative and highly atmospheric while still be very accessible. paranoid android is also an amazing track and likely the most successfully experimental track off of ok computer smoothly transitioning though several completely different phases before it ends somewhat suddenly to great effect. subterranean homesick alien probably the lushest song here with heavy use of electronic instrumentation and effects. exit music for a film is probably the heaviest track and is actually genuinely depressing. it is fairly minimalistic and actually seems to predict the general direction of radioheads next album kid a. let downs titled is misleading because it is not actually a letdown ha ha look guys i made a funny laugh with me laugh at my joke please . hell let down is probably the most upbeat song on this album even though it is not as out there as the other highlights. after that is karma police which is likely the most popular song off of ok computer and it is easy to see why. it is probably the best song lyrically and the music really captures the vibe radiohead seems to be going for. this would have been a great end to ok computer if it was an ep. but sadly fitter happier had to happen. really the term pretentious hipster bullshit has never been more applicable to a song than here. i can sort of see what radiohead was going for here but they really miss the mark. fitter happier might have worked as an intro to a longer song but on its own it is shit. as bad as fitter happier is at least it still kept with ok computers general mood. the next song electioneering although a fairly solid rocker is completely out of place here. climbing up the walls is probably the most unmemorable track on this album and beyond that there is not too much to say. no surprises is actually pretty good but is also a bit out of place although not as nearly as much as electioneering is. lucky is another unmemorable tune like climbing up the walls but does manage to be somewhat more interesting. after all of this shit ok computer actually manages to finish up on a high note with the tourist which is pretty damn breathtaking. it is just a shame so much mediocre and out of place material came before it. so what is the final verdict on ok computer? well i can some it up as an album with a great first half a mediocre second half and a great end. if you cut out all of the out of place and flat out bad material ok computer would live up to its reputation. still the good tracks are good enough so i would feel bad to give it anything lower than a 4 out of 5. it is also a big step forward for radiohead and they did seem to be experimenting a lot. it is just that they would end up doing much better on later releases. if the bland tracks were distributed throughout the album rather than all concentrated in the second half i would probably rate it higher. when you really think about it ok computer is an example of how the tracklist organization can actually end up ruining an album. anyways i just do not see what the big deal is here. as the ever so infamous piero scaruffi said radiohead is basically faux avant-garde. however unlike him i do not see ok computer as the masterpiece of it. edit my opinion of this album has shifted a bit since i last reviewed it and probably not for the better. still think the second half is definitely the weakest aside from the tourist but i find the whole album a bit lacking.,0
i give this 0.5 stars just to bring it down from all-time 2 !!! to where it belongs maybe somewhere about 200 for its influence maybe this album explains how crappy the 2000-2010 decade was?. the only two songs that actually show respect toward the listener are subterranean homesick alien and lucky. paranoid android and karma police have probably been recorded to torture prisoners in guantnamo. i loved in rainbows and i think johnny greenwood is one of the greatest musicians alive. but seriously id rather run a full marathon with a rotting corpse shackled to my feet than having to sit through the whole of this album.,0
so this is one of the top albums ever according to the site. well i do like my radiohead and though this album is rather good this is not even my favourite album with the band. the album still has a lot of creativity variations in both songs styles and tempo but so do most others of the bands albums as well. good groovy and thoms voice suits the whole and also manage to deliver feelings through the music.,0
el tan alabado por la crtica britnica ok computer el supuesto sgt peppers de los 90 la verdad es que no me dice absolutamente nada. temas facilones msicos normalitos un cantante de afectadsima pose ninguna innovacin un montn de atmsferas y arreglos electrnicos y poco ms. no dir que el lbum es una mierda paranoid android y karma police lo salvan pero hasta cualquier disco de por ejemplo unos dire straits le da cien patadas a esto. a qu se debe el hype de este disco entonces? tengo un par de teoras al respecto y ninguna me gusta.,0
i am slightly fond of this album and when rating it song by song i like it more that i thought. radiohead just is not to my taste but because of the heaps of unanimous praise they get i wish they were. consider yourself lucky.,0
so now i have finally dared to seriously listen to what according to rym is the 1 album of all times which i have always strongly doubted -- i listened to this once about 10 years ago it did not leave any memories. my first impression was although the music is interesting complex and often beautiful -- i just cannot stand thom yorkes singing. that bloody nagging bratty voice and this moaning singing that was oh so en vogue in 90s britpop. it gets on my nerves on a very basic primal level so i knew i would not be able to really enjoy this album especially the tourist really hurts my ears. however on further listens i started getting a little used to that voice and the songs where yorkes singing stays in the background started growing on me like airbag and subterranean homesick alien. it was not too artsy-fartsy as i feared the production is immaculate and the songs are full of little surprises synth details interesting twists without breaking apart staying a coherent pleasing whole. and that exactly is my gripe with this album. it s a little too coherent and pleasing for me to really raise my interest. it all feels too intellectual too thought-out too self-conscious too slick and polished to me. for me great music needs more than just a pleasing melancholic mood melancholy sells well it needs more than sophistication and ideas -- it needs an element of irrationality of spontaneity and exuberance of revolt and fracturedness of personality. which ok computer just does not have. and thus it cannot compare with i.e. angel dust my own personal perfect 1990s alt rock album. and of course great music needs a voice that does not piss me off. considering this the fact i have this album a good rating is no minor feat. it is no coincidence that my favourite on here is fitter happier this weird text read by some microsoft windows 3.x-style computer voice -- this is the only song that has some genuine darkness and experimentality and none of that nasty voice. all in all as much as i would have liked pompous ass that i am i cannot say this is a bad album quite on the contrary it is a remarkable britpop album with a proggish edge for mature mainstream altindie audience and i understand now why it is so popular. but no way would i call it greatest album ever.,0
its a good album of a good band. but beatles pink floyd led zeppelin and other big bands albums are much better than ok computer. a believe that most people that vote here does not know this fantastic albums.,0
i have interesting feelings over this album. if you were to strip away every single concept from this album it sounds pretty alright. it is atmospheric and melancholy in strange jagged ways and that is kind of neat. it does it well enough that i think this would probably be a really nice experience for some people. it is a little too lacking in energy and purpose to appeal to me for more than a few songs at a time but still it is not bad and it is not exceptional and it fills your ears in a respectably pleasant consistent way and for that i give it the score it has. so what about the concepts? actually ... that overarching oh woe is me i am so sophisticated and modernity is making me so lifeless and purposeless thing irritates the crap out of me and as a result i cannot really warm up to the genuinely decent melodies on here. or maybe more fairly ok computer sets all this whining to music that does not do anything interesting with it and that irritates the crap out of me. it is kind of a shame that ok computer is so layered in concept because it would have been a reasonably enjoyable album if it did not sound so much like emo for adults.,0
overrated radiohead for me is like u2 in the years of achtung baby however less danceable more depressed. but nothing revolutionary. just the usual british rock,0
the pinnacle of radioheads career before the need to be groundbreaking took over.,0
this is a good album but hardly a great one. to be honest i have listened to it a few times but never feel inclined to pick it out specially - there is too much other good music out there. while sounding of its time there is very little here that is particularly original - guitar-driven rock played at a moderate tempo with some electronic effects thrown in - not particularly melodic. the best tracks are karma police and no surprises and we will excuse radiohead using the chords from the beatles sexy sadie on the former - if you are going to copy from someone else why not copy from the best. generally therefore a pleasant enough listen but hardly essential. airbag - 2.5 paranoid android - 3.5 subterranean homesick alien - 3 exit music - 3 let down - 2.5 karma police - 4 fitter happier - 1 climbing up the walls - 2 no surprises - 4 lucky - 3 the tourist - 3.5,0
easy music. easy hooks and riffs. too light. at the same time mildly depressing. its got nothing on kid a. i cannot get into this. yes of course it works and of course the songwriting is excellent. but it leaves me feeling a bit hollow. guitar driven pop songs with an idiosyncratic broody distinctly radiohead atmosphere on top. its unfulfilling,0
i have always put off listening to this lp since 1997. it has not aged well. it is higher quality than most pop music in 1997.,0
emi shows how great it is at marketing. it is not bad but it is not the greatest album ever made either. i can see why it people love it so much the electronics used in a time when there was a big rebellion against it britpop and grunge and they were used to make texture and atmosphere and not to get a cheap synth pop hit how much credit can radiohead take from that? a lot of it has to do with the improvements of synths and effects pedals etc. from the 80s and nigel godrichs production put together the acoustic electro-acoustic and electronic experiments into a seamless statement plus pop songwriting was at the core. however thom yorkes vocals..... no thanks. i will say i do prefer this album to any other rock album in the top 100 that is for sure.,0
i just cannot stand situation that this masterpiece is acclaimed as the best album of all time. seriously guys get your ears out of shitholes. karma police is the most pretentious thing i have ever heard.,0
possibly the most overrated album of all time. the praise heaped upon radiohead easily surpasses all of the undeserved acclaim the beatles get when it comes to hype versus actual talent. i have still yet to hear anyone justify why this release is among the greatest of all time. that said it is still a solid album though i prefer amnesiac.,0
generally when i sit down to write a review i am pretty clear about the specific points i want to get across and i hope that at least some of the time i manage to inform or entertain fellow rymers in some small way or other. the problem with an album like ok computer is that everything that needs to be written about this album has surely been committed to paper or pc screen already. for once then i am prepared to beg steal or borrow when it comes to the preparation of this review. so with apologies to iai here goes. yes i am white. yes i am middle class. yes i was a student. yes i have had my problems with women. no i do not play guitar. yes i have cut my hair in the last 6 months. no i do not wear band t-shirts and baggy trousers all the time. no i do not dabble in recreational drugs. yes i enjoy my pretensions of liking all genres of music. and no ok computer is not an album that i can connect with in any meaningful way. do not get me wrong i can appreciate that every note of this album has been laid down with immaculate care and attention by a band at the top of their game. but it leaves me cold. if this is music that describes the alienation of growing up in 1990s britain then maybe i spent too much of that decade living abroad. but i think it has more to do with ok computer being a generational thing. after all how many people twenty years younger than myself would be able to appreciate the importance of closer to me in my formative teen years? in truth i was waiting throughout the first few tracks for some moment to hit me. maybe some unforgettable hook or lyric. i thought that moment had perhaps arrived on karma police when thom yorke suddenly breaks free and sings for a minute there i lost myself. the irony was not lost on me. soon after we are back in the atmospheric middle ground where this album largely resides. as yorke himself states no alarms and no surprises please. hooray for being a forty-something. and yes i do vote liberal democrat.,0
one of the most over rated bandsgroups of all time. this is one of their better albumscds. so much of their material sounds the same. i guess it is considered cool to be a radiohead fan???,0
this is stuff personally i have to be in the mood to listen to. but once i am and get into it this is actually pretty good. but do i understand the hate for a band like this?absolutely.,0
unlike kid abc this has songs and well-arranged ones at that. but the lyrics were written by a sixth-form serial masturbator with no connection to anything worthwhile. remember that old oscar wilde quote about the definition of a cynic? he knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. the author of these songs in both content and delivery shows that he not only knows the value of nothing but he does not know the cost either. utterly divorced from anything that music is meant for which is odd given some of the genuinely inspired chord movements and indicative of a schizophrenic song-writing partnership. that and pushing the old nwo transhuman and alien agendas - thanks guys. yeah we know that there are ufos around but let us not go jumping to any alien conclusions okay? and stop whining. and stop winking.,0
the better half of the tracklist is on a completely different level compared to the lesser half. but the overall theme of the album keeps those songs relevant  airbag let down,0

from the album booklet jump out of bed as soon as you hear the alarm clock!! you may also find it useful spending five minutes each morning saying to yourself every day in every way i am getting better and better perhaps it is a good idea to start a new day with the right frame of mind.,0
i have tried oh how i have tried to understand why this album receives so much praise but i have to admit i just do not get it. i have owned the album since the week it came out back in the late 90s and i have given it chance after chance to sink into my apparently thick skull to no avail. i hate it. i feel like i am the last one to see the hidden picture in one of those secret eye pictures. i enjoy the album that is not the issue. the problem is that i do not get its supposed greatness and its placement as one of the greatest albums of all time. i just do not see it. that being said i will say that i think this is a good album. the standout tracks are airbag paranoid android and one of radioheads greatest songs karma police. i will continue to try to find out what i am missing i guess but music should not be this hard to enjoy. until then i find this to be a 3.5 album.,0
it seems that radiohead really wanted to say something important with this album they almost do but betray their true desire to say everything.,0
como uno ya lleva sus aos en este mundillo es difcil que la pura serendipia -paranoid android- o el deja vu -karma police y exit music for a film- junto a un puados de temas totalmente intrascendentes me lleguen a impresionar aunque sea un poco. y como uno trata de ser objetivo aunque le repateen entre otras muchas cosas la gran estafa de la crtica de las dos ltimas dcadas -ambas dcadas dicho sea de paso flojsimas en el aspecto musical- y el sempiterno borreguismo de la gente no dir que ste es un disco de mierda ni nada parecido slo puedo decir que es tal vez el disco ms ridculamente sobrevalorado de todos los tiempos. y es que ya tiene que estar mal la cosa como para que se ensalce hasta la nusea un disco tan mediano como el que me ocupa ahora mismo. malos tiempos.,0
its almost heresy to write that this is overrated album from overrated band but this is how i always feel about every rh album. i frankly like these guys but just as typical british band which had its momentum with creep. their second album should be at piedestal of top british bands of their time actually. since then they slowed down made more fuss and cloudy feed-backs but nothing that you would have been heard anywhere else. karma police from particular album is an awesome song with fantastic atmosphere paranoid android is okay but the rest? sorry sorry but its boring. its very hard to compose structured songs slow noisy whispering feed-backed... because to make it fantastic you just need to have fantastic normal song behind. and this is with all honesty the area where the radiohead lacks most of the times. compare it with jesus and mary chain first albums - almost same structure of every song but these were almost beatles-quality songs behind. this is what makes a difference between top and overrated band.,0
i think not. i like radiohead but this is in no way even close to the greatest album of all time. this is not even the best in their own discography. karma police is lazily written but lyrically expressive which  no quality control and does not bring anything to the table that bob dylan did not bring already. they get points for including their honest work on here as well subterranean homesick alien etc and intersperse it with paranoid android no surprises karma police... see where i am going here? half of it is indeed great material but to raise an album up so high when more than half of it is completely unoriginal i must assume that most people here that rated it have little or biased musical taste. or simply made an account just to up-rate. i mean better than in rainbows? on that album they at least collided their sonic subtleties with their poppy hooks within each song instead spread separately across the track list. in summary i like this album a lot but is this the best? come on do you really think that?,0
i have sat on this album for years. it still does not do much for me. i guess i am just writing something now because it is one of my moms most recent obsessions along with that snow patrol song run. oh well. i like subterranean homesick alien.,0
no best album of all time would have fitter happier on it.,0
vivement que le chanteur mue de la voix ! il doit approcher des 14 ans maintenant,0
3.5 it is a good album do not get me wrong at times great even. it is rated highly though because it is an artistic album that can appeal to many different people who can appreciate artistic qualities of many different genres. in essence this is an album which has something for everyone. for me there is paranoid android the most epic of all radiohead songs and a heavy contributor on why i started searching for the obscure diamond in the rough gems of artistic music. subterranean homesick alien and electionering also rank up there as some of the top radiohead songs for me as well but i cannot fool myself into saying this is as good as the bends which i still prefer to ok computer. now i may rediscover this album combining it with in rainbows - if you do not understand research the comparisons and synergy between these two albums i still have not yet combined these two albums yet in experimentation in which case a higher or lower rating may result from 10 years of planning a supposed perfect complement to which is already considered one of the greatest albums of all time. i can already hear it now - nude and subterranean homesick aliens free and easy going style with 15 step the perfect transition with airbag and paranoid android.,0
this is the highest rated album on rym? really? really!? really?!?!? i have given this album over 10 forced listens and granted while it is agonizing at first it got less painful the most i listened to it. the problem is thom yourkes whiny singing voice that sounds like a cats being tortured. and he sings like that on every track and does not mix it up making the entire album sound the same in that regard. for those of you familiar with mellon collie and the infinite sadness a vastly superior album imagine if billy corgan sang the entire album like he did on here is no why. or to forgive. or bodies. or stumbleine. it would not sound nearly as good. granted paranoid android is an outstanding song and karma police is good too but by the time you get to the latter you are just tired of that whiny singing. the rest of the tracks kind of describe my feelings of the album let down is what i think this album is no surprises is what it gives you in the singing style and lucky is what you will be if you can make it through a listen without gouging you are ears out. best tracks paranoid android and karma police. worst tracks pretty much the rest. overall proceed with caution. listening to this album is like musical masochism.,0
what a piece of shit. i could not even get through the whole thing. this is a perfect example of enough people saying something is good and a bunch of other people following their lead. radiohead is trash and this album is proof that they should stop making music,0
an alright record trying to ape pink floyd but being weird. its whiny antics only really come through as intense on paranoid andriod. an alright record but no diamond in the rough.,0
tout a mvoque limage dun grand building dentreprise  une banque ou je ne sais pas quoi. on pourrait faire une vido de lalbum en passant en acclr les employs qui sortent discuter et fumer leur cigarette. ok computer est la musique du monde froid que radiohead dnonce.. ils ont fait de ce quils dtestent un album ce qui nest rien dautre quun manque de subtilit  incapables de donner du contraste  leur idal on peine  ressentir vraiment ce quok computer a dhumain.,0
widely regarded as one of the best albums to come out of the 90s radioheads ok computer changed the band from a directionless incoherent mass of pity and self loathing to a band that strived to reach the excesses of its name and to elevate it to higher levels of credibility. the album itself is excellent for breaking new ground in a rather stagnant rock crowd that was befalling the genre in the early and later part of the decade but in all honesty there is something about it that always leaves a stale taste in my mouth whenever i re-listen to it. it is a cold metallic almost lifeless construct of chords and chorus structures. it just feels so artificial despite how progressive it actual is for an alternative rock album. i always liken it to the dark side of the moon if it was made in the 90s and had its cynical edge turned up and a touch of 80s idmpunk like aesthetic thrown in. that is what it feels like at least a groundbreaking album in one sense and a giant plodding fucking mess in another. there is method to my madness though. there is nothing quite like it and there will not be again but at the same time it sounds so tired a dull i just......i cannot call it a classic. it is dripping with the whole corporateself pittying malaise that the 90s seemed to bring out in everyone from musicians to hollywood it does it though in such a way that really does put you out of sorts at least for me anyway. all i can really say is its an excellent album but for some reason i feel really uncomfortable listening to the whole thing it either depresses me or dulls me. except no surprises that is the only song i actually can listen to without any null side effects..... for what it is its definitly a strong album but far...far from being as universally praised as it should be. its melancholic and malaise ridden theme makes it an absolute drudge to get through. playing the album through must have been one of the most depressing exsperiences i have ever had. in that regard though it deserves some merrit. track pics paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police no surprises.,0
given this is the top rated record on this site i decided to try it again maybe it is me and i am just missing something. i listened to it carefully three times and my conclusion still stands this is just a meh album. i really do not see what the fuss is all about? and i still think that yorkes vocals are irritating.,0
for years i saw this album as the record of the 90s... now it seems to me a little overrated... it is a good record but not that good... i mean... like the velvet underground  nico?.... thom yorke as lou reed?...no my friends not even close...,0
how is this album ranked number 1 of all time. its probably top 5 albums of the 90s. id put 2 rage against the machine albums ahead of this one. but i gave this a lower rating than it deserves i am just evening it out for the better deserving beatles albums. i think the beatles deserve at least the first 3 spots. anyways paranoid android and karma police are the obvious classics electioneering is probably my favorite of the album. hey radiohead fans you can start listening to sonic youth now.,0
the most popular album ever. not just is this the most popular album on rym but it is the one that is always coming on top of tvradiomagazine polls. why!? obviously a lot of people ask themselves the same question whether they are big radiohead fans or not. i am not a big radiohead fan but i do not rate this as really shit compared to their other stuff which is where i feel i stand out. in fact i would say this is average or so. one of the problems i have with it is how much i have listened to it. i put it onto my mp3 player and pc years ago when i only had a few thousand songs and the tracks came up on shuffle so often. i really could not help but sicken myself of it. most music probably would become a bit dull after so many listens although certainly not all and i can think of a good number of records i had at that time which i never became bored with and still hold as very dear to me. in other words not being sick of this album would not increase my rating. i have been as objective as possible here! tracks like paranoid android exit music and karma police regardless of what i have just said will probably never bore me. but not much else has such resistance to over-listening. i suppose the lesson you can take from ok computer is that it shows you the bad and the good of what radiohead are. there are some really beautiful moments in the aforementioned tracks but there are also some really dull dreary moments. of course even in the best moments it is pretty easy to become more than a little melancholic. exit music is about the worst for this. i cannot listen to it without feeling my soul being torn apart just a little. fact i have never listened to this album in the correct order. i put it onto my computer years ago the cd is my fathers but for some reason it ended up in m4a format and when i converted to mp3 i had lost the encoding on the files thus the track numbers were all set as 1. i could of course have sorted it but i am really not that anal. i do not assume order would affect my rating although i know radiohead are the kind of band who probably would want things just so like that.,0
i have given this record so many chances. in the end i always come out meh.,0
an okay album. it did not overwhelm me as i expected from such a popular album  it drifted along in a derivative mode okay.,0
i had never really cared much for the little i had heard of radiohead before listening to this album but this album surprised me. airbag was somewhat appealing. then paranoid android comes on and blows me away. unfortunately i cannot say the same about the rest of the album during which i found myself itching for it to just end already. regardless a respectful effort.,0
generally completely fucking tiresome to sit through but it does have a couple catchy numbers strewn throughout. no surprises sums up the entire album. starts off well enough with some rocking numbers before tripping over with exit music and let down which are obvious filler. karma police picks it up again and climbing up the walls and no surprises rounds off the album nicely before thom yorkes maudlin croon overtakes the end with some awful stadium sized anthems.,0
ok computer that is enough! anything that is number one of anything has to be overrated.,0
uhm overrated as hell. there are some songs that are quite good paranoid android no surprises exit music but also has a lot of fillers fitter happier the tourist electioneering. note that i am in fact a radiohead fella but this album is not good as kid a hail to the thief or in rainbows. nuff said he goes and listen to idioteque,0
hmm... i do not get it. ok this is a nice album but there is nothing which makes me say this sounds like a masterpiece or even the best album of all time -- a bit overrated is not it?,0
my favorite track is no surprises. airbag is a strong opener. the medium tempo song combines a rythmic trance beat inspired by dj shadow with dream like overtones to set the mood for the album and showcases one of thom yorkes stronger vocal performances which in general is not the bands most formidible aspect.,0
do not get the love for this album i find it quite boring. kid a is much better.,0
airbag parts of paranoid android and all of exit music are either good or really good. it is just after exit music ok computer is just swamped in boredom stuffs that simply go nowhere. i have no problem with the high praise for this album but i choose not to listen unless i have an insomnia bout.,0
i really enjoyed this when i was in high school. now that i am older i cannot believe i ever liked it so much i honestly will never understand why this gets so much love i can never get throught it...let down is the only track i seek out to listen too ever now,0
you know i do not think many people have taken a step back and looked at this album or radiohead in general and asked themsevles what is it about this band that i like? i feel like it is become this default notion that people who like alternative rock art rock or generes similar to those have to like radiohead. they have been around for a long time are still making music keep themselves out of the public eye and stick to their signature sound and style for the most part. nearly everyone i have talked to about radiohead says with confidence that this is their best ablum. with all due respect i disagree. i actually think the album is overrated. i used to listen to radiohead much more than i do now. as i got into other forms of music and started making my own music it kind of pushed me away from them a bit. i started thinking about each of their albums and when it came to ok computer i realized that i only really listen to maybe 30 of the album. airbag opens the album wonderfully i have always enjoyed it. everyone knows paranoid android but i actually think this song could have been a lot better. i think the song is a bit too complex for it is own good. i think it should have been a slower song in general. everything before the heavy breakdown should have been at a slower tempo and the chorus could have been something different. i like the heavy breakdown but after that i almost never listen to it. subterranean homesick alien has a lot of potential i think if it would have been an instrumental track it would have been much better. exit music for a film is a bit too somber and plain but it holds it is place on the album more than others. i think if thom yorkes vocals on it would have been a bit lower and with effects it would have been better. let down had a lot of potential as well but where they took the song with the drums and rhythms just does not grab me. a lot of the vocals on this album i just do not like enough. karma police is the first real standout track on the album. i would not change anything about this song. i actually would have probably made this song longer but is not that a compliment? fitter happier is a take it or leave it song purely filler but it has the lyrics that many radiohead fans seem to like. electioneering has a pearl jam feeling to it that i know many people like but it is never been a good song to me. climbing up the walls should have been a strictly instrumentals song maybe with faint vocals with lots of echo effects as the song picks up. no surprises is the second real standout track on the album. from the second it comes on your attention is grabbed and you feel like you are on this little cloud. it has such a nice style to it i have always really enjoyed it. lucky to me is too much pink floyd and it is never found it is way into me. it is not a bad song but it is just not a song i enjoy. thom yorkes vocals have actually come to bother me in a way. they have this whining quality about them that seems to repeat itself. the tourist is one of the stronger tracks on the album but again should have been without vocals. i would actually like to see a strictly instrumental album by radiohead i think that would be pretty amazing. after this album radiohead became more experimental and recorded what i think are better albums kid a and amnesiac. for all the music they make like red hot chili peppers and many other bands how many of their songs do you really honestly listen to and enjoy?,0

the most overated album of all time yes paranoid android is an epic karma police is damn good and no suprises is okay...the rest is crap...i have listened to it about 100 times to try to get it but generally it is very very bland.,0
if i could get rid of everything but the guitar - it might be ok but once again the vocalist pisses on what might have been ok. mind you just ok.,0
first time i heard this i admit i was blown away. i had never heard anything like it there certainly is no denying these guys talent. but for some reason this album did not have the staying power i thought it would. the first 6 tracks are great but with the exception of no suprises it just fades out after that for me until soon enough i just got bored with it all together. no doubt a good record just do not see the massive hype this continues to get.,0
probuje cos tutaj znalezc interesujacego przyciagajacego ale nadal nie potrafie... e dwa bardzo dobre single? i tyle?,0
eine der besten platten aller zeiten?? fr mich definitiv eine der langweiligsten platten aller zeiten und obendrein miserabel produziert,0
i had not heard this album until today. it is a very easy record to admire - however after one play i am really not sure if i like it.,0
radioheads best album and a good album indeed but a bit overrated. the albums good points defintely starts the really good songs it has airbag climbing up the walls especially paranoid android. what a song! crazy that they got it from the beatles happiness is a warm gun which by the way is a great song too. if you have not listened to it you should check it out. but back to paranoid android if you do not like that song you do not like rock. period. another big plus is that none of the songs suck somell say fittier happier sucks cuz it is technically not a song but i feel it goes with the album in its own weird way. that is very rare to have an album where none of the songs suck. also the flow of the album as a whole is pretty good not on par with what is going on and sgt. peppers but still good. the lyrics are some of the songs electrioneering no suprises were interesting too. this album also sounds concentrated meaning they had a vision for every song on the album and came up with the melodies etc. to match the visions they had for the songs another plus. i personally am a fan of different types of music and like having different styles of music in my collection and this album is very left-field. it has it is own style which i love. it has quite a few drawbacks the main being while there are no whack songs only paranoid android airbag and climbing up the walls stand out to the point that you forget that you listened to the other songs. some songs like electrioneering no surprises and subterranean homesick alien are pretty good but they are no match for those 3 songs which brings it to another drawback the songs i said did not stand out almost all of them sound alike. i feel like i am listening to a variation of the same song throughout the album with a few outliers along the way. 3rd those songs are very boring as well. it has no hype to them at all. mainly it is because the music instrumental have no substance. their music is good because of the relms it creates. you can see the music but you cannot feel it and with that those songs sound alike and the fact that they are thinking beats and no rhythm beats it only adds up to boredom. another big problem is the singer himself. another rock frontman who cannot sing. he sounds like he whining the whole album. you know it is true especially when you cannot understand a word he is saying. that will make someone never listen to the album again. big turnoff. i had to look up the lyrics on the internet only to find most the lyrics do not make sense. ridiculous. as many flaws as it has i can actually see why this album has a following. i can also see why many radiohead feel it is their best album which it is and i can also see why people like the bends better. now kid a i do not know but i can see the bends. and as much as i said bad about this album it is actually pretty good but it is not for everyone another reason to add why it is not the best album in the world. the are quite a few rock albums better than this sgt. peppers revolver led zeppelin iv and loveless to name a few it is still better than a lot of other rock albums. listen at your own risk. best songs paranoid android their best song period not just best album song airbag climbing up the walls no surprises subterranean homesick alien worst song fittier happier,0
i never really listened to this until my early to mid 20s. had i back as a teenager i think i would have been much more affected by it. i listened to too much grunge american 90s radio alternative rock and nu metal i guess. i will probably go to my grave regarding fantastic planet as the holy grail of alternative rock. so considering all that and other circumstances i feel i will not ever fully connect to it but at least i have come to have reasonable appreciation for it. no doubt many people would still want to burn me at the stake regardless. this is symbolism at its finest.,0
great album all the tracks mesh well together - but not my favourite!,0
maybe i just do not get it but at times this is just dreary miserable music either that or it actually does suck hard.,0
1 star for the song paranoid android and 1 star for no surprises. rest is boring meaningless and completly devoid of soul and energy. such a waste of talented musicians buy the vastly superior the bends instead.,0
i think it is a pretty good album but to call this the greatest album ever made according to rym it is is the biggest joke i have ever heard. absolutely insane. no. no it is not.,0
i got this on cd a few years ago and i really feel like aside from all of my kiddy cds this is the worst one i own. i have always struggled with getting into this album despite the fact that i love radiohead.,0
bom lbum um tanto quanto pretensioso mas inegavelmente qualificado entre os melhores dos 1990s. a despeito de suas qualidades custo a entender sua imensa popularidade aqui no rym. melhor lbum de todos os tempos parece-me um exagero imperdovel. provavelmente no envelhecer com a mesma fora e ficar parecido com um dark side of the moon de final de sculo melanclico cheio de harmonias hipnticas e belo embora montono.,0
the music is great but the vocals make my ears bleed and totally detract from what could have been a great listening experience.,0
it distresses me that this is the 1 album on this site. i like karma police a lot but other than that i really think it is a terrible album. i have listened to it close to 10 times trying to get it to click but it just has not. as it is i could probably list 200 albums that are better than this.,0
1 for 1997  1 overall so it is official now is not it? not a surprise i guess since there are lots of records in the top 100 that i just do not rate that highly. as for this one... to say it is not as groundbreaking or innovative or even consistent and well written as people are led to believe would be insignificant next to the fact that it - obviously - speaks to so many of them personally. i guess i am just going to have to accept that. but ok computer is not the piper at the gates of dawn for christs sake! 710,0
i once reviewed this and then i took down the review. this is the type of record that i adored when i was younger i still like it but i cannot seem to get as much into it as i used to. i probably should give it a couple of more spins and try. i am still young but it just is not the same somehow even though it is still good. i am definitely not a grownup i refuse to believe that.,0
airbag - 2.5 paranoid android - 1.0 subterranean homesick alien - 3.0 exit music - 2.5 let down - 3.5 karma police - 2.0 fitter happier - na electioneering - .5 climbing up the walls - 3.0 no surprises - 3.0 lucky - 2.0 the tourist - 3.0 we all have things we like about music. a good beat? a good melody? a great chorus? layering? awesome vocals? brilliant lyrics? i have figured out why this album is considered the 2nd best album of all time according to rym... it is the lyrics... but to be honest lyrics are the last thing that i look for in music therefore this album does nothing for me really... but i can understand why a lot of people rave about this album... it just does not contain the aspects of music that appeal to me...,0
i was far more impressed with it in 97 than i am now. good songs but very depressing. the crazed electioneering is easily the best cut to these ears. it is actually been compared to dark side of the moon but lacks the cohesion and development of that classic. i guess it is one for the computerinternet generation though.,0
 airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien  exit music for a film  let down  karma police  fitter happier   electioneering  climbing up the walls no surprises  lucky  the tourist,0
this is a decent record paranoid android is a fantastic song and much of the rest of it holds up. however it is let down by fitter happier and electioneering...plus it is hard to listening to it from start to finish without feeling very tired thanks to the lack of excitement contained within.,0
i give this album 1 star for no suprises which is good....could care less about the rest.,0
a mess of good songs thrown helplessly together into what feels more like a compilation than an album. thankfully radiohead got themselves straight with kid a to follow.,0
why. god why? why does everyone like this album so much. i am sorry radiohead fans. i like the same kind of music as you. i like pink floyd. i like arcade fire. i like the mars volta. but i find absolutely nothing appealing about this album. i honestly cannot see whatever it is that other people see in this album. none of the instrumentalism is particularly impressive nor is the lyricism nor is thom yorkes voice which actually gets on my nerves pretty substantially because you cannot understand a word he is saying. i listened to this album the entire way through several times because i really wanted to like it and the only track i found even moderately entertaining was karma police but even that just feels like it lacks substance. pink floyd makes the experimentalpsychedelic concept album work because their riffs are memorable and their lyrics are worthy of singing in the shower. in other words they are accessible. and while some people may criticize accessibility in a band claiming that it means they are too mainstream or that they have sold out i find it an absolute must have for me to appreciate a band. in essence what radiohead has done here is create an paradoxical album that is difficult to listen to but requires several full listens to comprehend. the only reason i would ever listen to this album again is because of it is reputation - i feel like i am missing something but no matter how many times i listen to ok computer i never find it. two stars. best track karma police.,0
ok. i can see why this is rated so high. i absolutely hate this kind of melancholic music but this one is so mild and leaves me with such a nice feeling that i can say it is very good without any regret! nice job!,0
nothing really genius. though level of a quality raised fairly high. electioneering probably their best song ever for it is candid anger and respective powerful guitar parts.,0
id like to think there is music which i dont enjoy but which i believe is good- maybe dylan would qualify but then again i think i enjoy the best pieces of blonde on blonde. .. the first word that came to mind is mediocre but its not that not at all. i suppose that the words are excellent even if i cant make them out in the noise but musically this does not touch me in any way also it does not strike me as brilliant . there is one good song but not one bit of rockn roll here. p.s theres also music that i enjoy even if i think its not good. one thing i understand they are striving for something big. guess i have to come back to this one as i have heard this only a few times - but i do not look forward to it!!! !!!!! !!!!! 1111 !!! 111 !!!!! 11111 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!run while you still can. the wolves are around the corner yes they are and theyare going to eat you. any day now this is going to be all-time 1. its a generation thing - the stone roses too were voted 1 somewhere ten years after - how ridiculous- but it is the generation of machines. the machines are going to take over and it is the end. the end of the song its skin the single died a long time ago and im someone who loves loveless.,0
pretty good album. i loved it when i first heard it but that wore off pretty quickly - far quicker than the supposed 2nd best album of all time ever should. just allow me to offer some perspective here. this album is supposedly better than every bowie album televisions marquee moon pet sounds by the beach boys doolittle by the pixies forever changes by love every stooges album every velvet underground album every joy division release nearly every beatles album bar revolver every rolling stones who kinks and dylan album every hendrix neil young and john lennon album. this is a good record like ocean rain by echo and the bunnymen is a good album like chutes too narrow by the shins is a good album like too bring you my love by pj harvey is a good album. i think even radiohead have better albums than this and i think they would be slightly embarrassed to be ranked higher than the assembled legends of rock. i do not think it is an all time great but it is a decent record. they should have buried fitter happier though because that diabolically bad diatribe dates ok computer badly and after all everyone knows that the classics are supposed to be timeless...,0
half the best album ever made half a portent of things to come.,0
the speed bump in their prolific yet flaw-filled career. this is i am going to one of those flaws even though it has a few classics which are mostly the slower ones. the bends kid a and in rainbows may not be better albums but i like them more. you should definitely listen because most major publications think you are missing something if you have not yet. highlights paranoid android let down karma police no surprises the tourist least favorites electioneering,0
i will probably catch some heat from my buddies for not rating this higher. i can appreciate the fact that ok computer introduced me to a fresh and new direction of music when it came out. on most of the tracks i find myself listening to the great interplay between the instruments. the music is definitely atypical. i love the tempo changes in some of the songs as well as the occasional dissonance. the problem i have with radiohead is the vocals. i do not find enough contrast in the vocal style range tempo... to keep my attention. i understand that the sad bastard music radiohead so often promotes needs thoms voice to complete the music but i do not like the lazy approach to singing so many alternative bands take. i sometimes get sick of the same slow style of their music. for some reason i do not like many of the popular songs off this album. i do not particularly like paranoid android but like exit music the tourist and lucky. i can enjoy radiohead in small doses but i would not recommend this album. overrated? i do not know. i understand that it is a very popular album among many many people. however i think radiohead is not an elite band. if they cross the generation gap which i have yet to see in large amount i might be persuaded to think otherwise.,0
after hearing all the hype over this album i thought that i would try it however i was very disappointed it lacked in that special something that i want from my music. it failed to make me feel anything like the early works of mcfly. that rouses something deep inside me whereas this merely made me mildly hungry. however i had not actually had breakfast yet so it may not have been the raising for my aching belly. i struggled to understand the lyrics the style in which this guy sings really masks what he is trying to say. it is nothing on the crisp vocal of someone like hanson which allows me to hear the deep and heart-wrenching emotion driving their music whereas with this i am sure of whether there is any emotional stuff i can really get behind and cry over and stuff.,0
this album was a bit of a let down honestly. airbag and paranoid android are a stellar one-two punch showing us what radiohead can do with the progressive rock sound...and they are great. but most of the rest of the album falls flat...the best songs here are the ones that sound the most desperate. let down no surprises and lucky are great songs. let down has the most splendid outro i have ever heard. key tracks no surprises let down paranoid android lucky,0
hideously overrated but still good. its not the best album ever and most of the songs are seriously depressing slow and boring but somehow it works. paranoid android is indeed epic.,0
meio chatinho. obviamente no saquei a essncia do disco talvez o aprecio melhor num dia them que eu estiver um pouco deprimido! mas  claro que so msicas extremamente bem elaboradas no tiro o crdito de nenhuma e no acho ruim quando falam que o disco foi um marco nos anos 90 j que apesar de no ter gostado tem seus mritos. entendo porque muitos o colocam them um altar e louvam-no o que them minha opinio no  pra tanto mas o album faz por merecer.,0
having somehow heard kid a before hearing ok computer i still struggle to see why this album is considered their high point. not that it is bad but it does not hold the mystery of kid a for me.,0
hmm this album is the bane of my life. it is good! so why do i hate it so much? it is quite distressing to me. the music is fine but where is the warmth? i find this album nihilistic dull and void of any kind of energy. i have tried to listen to it again and again. it freezes me out every time.,0
according to this site it is one of the best albums of all time but there are some weak tracks. fitter happier is the lamest song ever made. subterranean homesick alien is nothing special. the tourist is one of their best soft songs but nowhere near as good as their hards. karma police is their best soft song and just outside of my top 100. electioneering is the best song on the album in my opinion and paranoid android is not that far behind. no surprises is a great song as well. not their best album but not their worst either. 8 album of all time is absolutely ridiculous though come on guys get some musical taste!,0
i just have to add my voice to the group that says huh?. i do not love it. i do not hate it. is it good? yes! is it the most incredibly wonderful album to appear in the past few decades? i do not think so. this is not a case of i have not listened to it enough or i have not been listening to it long enough. i have been listening to this fairly regularly since it came out over ten years ago. i even perk up my ears for paranoid android thinking that might give me a glimpse of what all the fuss and bother is about. it just does not grab me. yes it is good well-crafted ear-candy. no it is not superbly excellent.,0
so this is that album that everyone says is the best of the 90s and so on... if such a thing is possiblenaming a record the best of a certain period this is defenitly not the best album of the 90s. karma police  let down no surprises and electioneering are great songs undeniable but the rest bores me. one of the things that annoys me the most with radiohead is the fact that some songs could have been much more interesting ones. most of the songs especially airbag paranoid android and the tourist are good ones but they are too long and turn into somehing boring. i have never been a fan of radiohead i have to confess. i really wanted to listen their records in order to rate them properly. listened more than 5 times but they really fail to amuse me. this is not a bad record no way! i just think that it has nothing that makes it that really great record. if you also think that comparing ok computer with the de facto great records of the 90s mezzanine or blue lines massive attack rid of me and to bring you my love pj harvey homogenic bjrk dummy portishead to name a few is an heresy you better keep that thought with you unless you are ready to hearread things like you are retarded stupid and you do not like good music and do not really know what good music is. remember that is what you get when you mess with them,0
overrated simply put. there is no reason lyrically or musically that this should be on any top list for the 90s. it is a decent album of the 90s but there are far greater albums. i am very happy this got kicked to the curb by manic street preachers the holy bible in the newsnight quintessential poll. the bends is a far greater album. it is a masterpiece. this is just condensed and bloated with plenty of hype sort of like oasis be here now but before the release. some high points are exit music karma police airbag and no surprises but that is about it and it is inconsistent. people who do not really know music turn to this album and add to the cliche that it is great. this cliche is false it is fairly good and that is that.,0
i do not dislike it. it is a really good album. however it has a hard time competing with in rainbows kid a and especially the bends.,0
shoot me for it but i really do not like this album. it is not because i hate radiohead i really like the bends or because i hate everything that is not accessible i love troutmask replica stupid dream my life in the bush of ghosts and just about everything king crimson ever did it is just because i think these songs just are not that good. let us start with something positive and discuss the things on here that i like. airbag is a nice opener. the drum sound may be awful but the guitar riff is good and the whole song reminds me a bit of king crimsons red. that is a good thing. karma police is really a great song. as much as i hate thom yorkes voice i must admit the song is great and when sung by somebody else joe jackson performed it live in 1999 i actually enjoy it. subterranean homesick blues is also a fine song but give me anything from the bends over that anyday. then we have paranoid android. it starts off as a good song but it goes wrong once we get to the ambition makes you look pretty ugly part. from that bit onwards its an awful combination of thom yorke screaming loud guitars an awful guitar solo from somebody who obviously has not had a lot of guitar lessons is it jonny greenwood or ed obrien who cares? a slow closing section going back to a loud climax again at the end with no structure anywhere to be found. did i mention those lyrics offwithhisheadmantheyuppiesnetworkingthevomitwhydontyouremembermynamefromagreatheightgodloveshischildren sorry this stuff is not just my cup of tea. both exit music for a film and let down sound like travis at their worst lifeless uninspired britpop. abba sounds like hardcore punk compared to this. then there is also 2 minutes of nonsense spoken by a computer program another attempt at heavy metal or whatever one small bit of glockenspiel music that turns out to be an entire song and we get to hear thom yorke repeating hey man slow down slow down over and over again. as far as choruses go that is not really mr. tambourine man hey jude california girls satisfaction or sunny afternoon is it? the only thing good about that is that you know the albums over in a few minutes. i do not care what other people think about this album to me it is a deeply disappointing follow up to the excellent the bends. the band is obviously not playing it safe but to me this mix of nonsense lyrics unstructured songs and electronic effects just does not sound right. there are a handful of highlights which i have mentioned before but it is all not enough to make the album anything more than average.,0
i know your supposed to love this record but it never did anything for me some of the songs are catchy enough like subterranean homesick alien and let down but it is mostly fairly boring you do not have to completely give up on guitars lads seriously...,0
un album bien dcevant aprs le somptueux the bends qui annonce des changements dorientations musicaux. cest dailleurs le bon ct de ce groupe  lexprimentation. le problme cest qu vouloir trop voluer il arrive quon perde des fans de la premire heure en route. mis  part lexcellent karma police je naccroche pas du tout sur cet album qui a voulu tre trop grand et qui nest pas  la hauteur comme lhorripilant et intellectualisant pananoid android.,0
this is good music for some specific state of mind which is usually out of my reach.,0
one of the highest rated albums on all of rym. the band that paved the way for the current wave of british progressive rock bands which some of my all-time favourite bands like amplifier and oceansize are part of. logically i should love this but to me it is just decent. the sound is very good it is hard to think of anything that sounds similar to it which gives the album an unique feel. unfortunately the songs are not all very good. many of them such as subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film lucky and the tourist fail to keep my interest all the way through. i can stand listening to them though there are not any songs i flat-out dislike. and thankfully there are some songs that stand out from the bunch mainly paranoid android with its great guitars and let down and no surprises has very good vocals and melodies. airbag and karma police are a bit better than average as well.,0
sin el quizs el lbum ms sobrevalorado de la historia de la msica pop. slo hay tres canciones decentes la inventiva la innovacin brillan por su ausencia y la produccin es pattica cmo se puede respetar al tal nigel?. y la voz cantante? bien puede ser que nadie recuerde a neil young. entiendo que tras este disco dieran un giro no consiguieron lo que queran y siguen en el intento. slo por eso merecen mi respeto. ah y el tres de la puntuacin es porque me trae buenos recuerdos.,0
this album is so-so. kid a and amnesiac are much better in my opinion. the fact that people consider it one of the best records ever is bizarre. i just do not get it.,0
strange and vague of course that is the essence of the album but the lyrics do not make sense. sure the album has it is shining moments  karma police climb up the walls exit music. but it can be strange and depressing. paranoid android is such an awkward song never got that one it is just all over the place this album does have some good songs but best of the 90s? i am not biting.,0
nunca me ha gustado este disco aparte la musica de radiohead no me emociona. ok computer es un disco muy sobrevalorado al igual que sus creadores. creo que hay discos mucho mejores que este y nunca han recibido el reconocimiento que se merecen.,0
this cd is interesting. it has some really good use of technology and is not cluttered. there are some interesting musical ideas and in places it is melodic. the overall approach to the recording is nice and it sounds well thought out within it is parameters. the sound effects that augment the songs are interesting. but the musicianship and vocals lack. the drums are a bit too basic and the drummer seems to not venture out into territory other than basic beats. the acoustic guitar sounds are nice as are the clean guitar sounds but when the marshall stacks come out it sounds like the guitarists are trying to hide behind distortion rather than use the distortorted sounds to augment the music. the backround vocals are very nice very interesting. the lead vocals however are often the stereotypical whiney nasal style that pervades in alternative music. i do not think the vocals are well produced they do not stick out in the mix and it is impossible to follow the story line of the songs because the words are unintelligable most of the time. at times this kind of sounds like abba with not as good of vocals and musical showmanship. and it sounds like the music is all done in just a couple of music scales. overall the production is quite interesting and the shining element of the cd. the musicianship is lacking some but seems adequate for the music much of the time. for comparison this sounds like a less ambitious equal to synergy by porcupine tree. but overall it is interesting to listen to and is quite inventive at times. music that blows me away  as synergy did tends to reach out and grab me even if i am listening to it while doing other things. this cd did not do that often and toward the end of it i found myself not paying a lot of attention to it. this is nice music but nothing mind boggling. i do not understand what the hoopla about it is about. on the other hand i do see the appeal to it. i think with some better musicianship and some more inventive music that the arrangements would have worked a lot better. in fact it sounds almost as if the arrangments are too comlplex for the music and tend to get ahead of the music itself. i am glad i heard this and may give it another listen. it certainly is a keeper but not exactly the first thing i would reach for when looking for something to listen to in order to stimulate my mind. i think this cd could have benefitted with some more eclectic percussion sounds and at times some drums more along the lines of tool. and the bass could have been played against the highs a little better if it was a bit beefier.,0
there are some amazing songs on here but everything else is just filler. the sad thing is that those amazing songs have been killed by too much radio play.,0
yes karma police is wonderful and there are other songs worth mentioning paranoid android climbing up the walls but after 17 years i still think it is not as good as the majority of people out there believe.,0
very good learning material for modern young people to make good music....not best music,0
well... let us just say it is not my kind of music. classics are classics and this one fits in rightly with loveless from my bloody valentine amongst the making elaborate songs does not necessarily equals good music category. for good noise-rock or whatever this genre is called go for sonic youths trilogy evol sister daydream nation and goo instead,0
i bought this album after buying the bends and pablo honey back then i had only partially listened to those albums but at one point i used to listen to the bends before going to sleep. i had already listened to no suprises and karma police previously and had heard alot of people banging on about paranoid android. subterranian homesick alien the title partially stolen from a bob dylan song but not to the extent that it is black market oasis stolen is probably my favourite track on the album probably because it is as ambient and dreamy as songs from the bends. probably the main reason why i returned this cd to ask for my money back was because of all the indie kids and art school assholes who bang on about radiohead radioheadradioheadradioheadradioheadradioheadradiohead but also because the album itself did not do anything for me- i felt bored and sleepy. do not know maybe it is me maybe someone should slap me something silly. i cringe everytime i hear climbing up the walls because i think of all the music nuts in japan going waahhh everytime the singer mouths the first vocals. i myself could not make an album to save my life unless i told the everyone it was intended as an ironic joke and i can perhaps grasp the strain etc this band were under while making it but it is not something i would class as one of the greatest of all time. to others perhaps but not myself thanks. before i even listened to radiohead the name did make me vision a group who is music is a fusion of rock electronica.,0
goddamn music videos are influencial.,0
i think the trick behind this album is that it is so well-produced that most listeners take the weak spots - and there are a lot - too literal and see them as part of the limbo atmosphere.,0
i have owned ok computer since the week it came out and i am a little surprised how it has grown in stature. left for dead by the public upon its initial release but not critics ok computer quickly became the best album of all-time when the 14 year-olds of 97 started up their blogs and webzines in the 00s. to me the sound of the record is too cold. between no surprises and the computer-voiced fitter happier ok computer seemingly is the sound of losing all hope and wallowing in it. though very well done wallowing. perhaps some will see it as a call to arms but i do not know even yorkes vocals on exit music for a flim suggests that he is worn out and has given up when the lyrics suggests that he should be fighting for his love juliet?. it is just that even at my most cynical i hold on to shreds of optimism and i guess i want that reflected in my music as well. i saw radiohead in concert back in june because i had access to some tickets and i looked into the crowd during paranoid android and it seemingly was a group of people that collectively feel disaffected by and powerless against their surroundings. perhaps it is a feeling that i sometimes share but not necessarily one i want to augment. of course this review may seem contradictory to my 4.5 rating of the bends and my 4.0 review of the eraser but the former rawks a lot more than ok computer and there is a sense of humanity in the eraser. i just do not think i could ever embrace something this bleak.,0
good but not great and only mildly daring. thom yorke style plaintive wail replaces butt rawk howl as overdone vocal trend of the decade. but howling can sometimes be impressive. nice production on ok computer and at times quite rocking. some good musical ideas but listening to this album is a bit of a chore. overall not particularly enjoyable or inspiring. based on rym ratings quite overrated. too much vague ranting not enough hope or solutions. cold and rather devoid of any emotional resonance. if thom yorke really despises the modern conditions the world is in what is he doing using an arena rock band with all modern electronic conveniences? it is these contradictions that are the same failing as dark side of the moon. if yorke cares so much he should pick up a fiddle shut up play jigs dance and give people something worth living for. pink floyd already made bloated stiff albums in the mid 70s. ok computer really is dark side of the moon part two. anyone who thinks this is one of the all time greats has not explored enough music. even radiohead would go on to do slightly better. why be afraid? get out of your head and dance a bit.,0
          ...            ... .                        - creep.         -.            .       paranoid android  karma police. 7  10,0
ok computer could be described as noise-rock. it is not your regular rock music it is kind of intellectual not always melodic rarely pretty but usually interesting. thom yorke the android doing most of the programming whines his way through the songs. his singing probably makes the album even less accessible than does the challenging nature of the music. the songs seem to fall into two basic camps pained and depressed on the one hand and sceptical and faithless on the other. in the first category are exit music for a film and the totally depressed sounding let down. in the second category are paranoid android karma police and fitter happier not so much a hidden track as a small-print-track on my cd. electioneering is the closest radiohead get to rocking out and the topic is punk in character - skepticism directed at politicians. what is clear from the songs is that radiohead are disillusioned and disenchanted with the world around them. and this to such an extent that even a song entitled lucky sounds as if it sung by the unluckiest person on earth. finally in tourist they tell us to slowdown. that is a piece of advice most of us could do well to follow in our hectic time-pressured lives. all in all it is pretty glum listening. something for a damp grey winters day maybe. it is not totally without reward for the listener but there is much easier gratification to be found elsewhere. plus you do not have to listen to yorkes singing!,0
pull me out of the aircrash the bends had established radiohead as an important band but the trouble was that it was a fully-formed realisation of their sound so they had to look beyond the realms of ordinary guitar rock for their next album. ok computer confirmed radioheads staying power and gave them a permanent reservation to dine at rock musics top-table. after the musical conservatism that had been the trademark of far too much british guitar music in the mid 90s ok computer was an album of vaulting ambition which caused rock bands around the world to take a long hard look at themselves and wonder why they had not thought of that. ok computer was by turns rocking tender terrifying and utterly depressing which was more than enough to lodge in the psyche of every moody and disenchanted soul in their late teens and early twenties. radiohead had become the voice of a generation by pointing out that we are all going to hell in a handcart. ok computer is a musically inventive intelligent and hugely pretentious album. it is prog-rock reinvented for the new millennium something which left marillion trying to claim that they had been doing it for years. they had not. it has guitar anthems like electioneering no surprises is a twisted nightmare of a lullaby lucky and paranoid android are songs which make the best of their complex arrangements and fitter happier is a pep-talk typed out in simpletext with speach enabled. cast just were not capable of stuff like this. there is a downside though such musical invention led to radiohead sounding even more smug than usual which is something of a turn off for me. yes it is a clever album but is there any need to be so bloody self-satisfied about it? thom yorkes vocals in particular suffer from his desire to deliver everything in angst-ridden whine instead of delivering the lyrics in a clear and understandable manner. personally i think yorke sounded better on the bends. perhaps this is unfair nit-picking ok computer is unarguably one of they key albums of the 90s as it encouraged all manner of bands to raise their respective games. it could be argued that ok computers inventiveness revealed the inherent deficiencies in so many sub-par british guitar bands which caused so many of these bands to eventually split due to lack of public interest. what cannot be argued is that it made ambitious rock fashionable again. ambition makes you look pretty ugly,0
i used to really enjoy this album but it is not aging well. too derivative. in a few years radiohead will not even be on the radar anymore.,0
still trying to get this one. it is an interesting listen that i plan to revisit but at this point i just do not see what all the hoopla is about. still like kid a and the bends much better.,0
i think this is a growersleeper of an album... upon the first listening i kind of went a-huh it is ok nice lush sounds etc but it did not grab me - yet. but i am willing to give it a change to grow on me.,0
i have listened to this about half a dozen times so far. good but still waiting for the magic to kick in. maybe another few dozen listens... i will review my rating then!,0
this was the first radiohead album i have bought and truthfully i was expecting something different but instead i got something really different. after one listen all the way through it i did not know what to think about this album. i had heard a lot about this from other sources and friends and decided to check it out. honestly i think it is slightly overrated. maybe even out of its element being released in the late 90s. i would recommend listening to some of the songs off this album before you buy just to make sure you will like it when you hand over the cash.,0
very much overrated but not a bad album. let us see... songs i liked paranoid android is undoubtedly the best song on the album and an extremely fun song to play on guitar remmember the video!? that was a fucked up one. they should do more animated videos because yorkes chameleon eyes freak me out. it is like he can look in 2 places at once. other good songs include karma police because it sounds like sexy sadie no surprises which is nice and simple sounding and finally lucky which is probably the second best song on the album. songs i am indifferent to airbag is alright although for some reason it reminds me of a u2 song which is not good because u2 sucks. subterranean homesick alien is a poor followup to paranoid android. let down is a let down. fitter happier is only a few levels above the beatles no9 which means its barely tolerable. electioneering is actually an alright song but not as good as the ones in the like section. if it were not for the ending then the tourist would be in the section below. songs that i hated exit musiccrap. climbing up the walls is also a shitfest very much like old floyd trying to creep you out but just sucking really bad. so all in all most of the songs are okay. this album is not all its cracked up to be and from what i hear the bends has a more rounded selection of good songs. a good one but not the best.,0
no doubt that ok computer was one the most important albums of the past decade a breakthrough in the alternative scene of the late 90s. it carried a totally new sound and became the inspiration for many posterior bands. above all revitalized the tired brit pop and showed another way darker more introvert and intricate. it is by far radioheads best shot as a whole it has a specific concept and conveys a certain message. the problem for me is that there is no a creep song in that album. i mean that i have got enough of experimentations and impressive tricks. what i miss is a song that can touch me and stick in my head for more than 10 years. the one that comes close to it is no surprises. all the others are admirable efforts rather superficial though.,0
ok computer is only an ok listen. regardless of the sonic imagination trend-setting and endless acclaim there is still no escaping thom sounding insufferably whiny.,0
ok computer radiohead took their successful rock sound of the bends and experimented with it. now to a lot of people the word experimentation can be pretty scary it means something new something different and oh my is that scary. however experimentation sometimes fails and sometimes it fails miserably and unfortunately that is the case we have here. a reviewer for my school paper said this about this album a technological bore not at all ok computer. if i may borrow that term i believe it characterizes this album perfectly a technological bore. radiohead took their rather unique style of british rock and layered it with so called soundscapes. these soundscapes range from unnecessary to annoying to boring with nothing good along. at times they are just used to heavily and interfere with the good playing going on beneath them. at other times when they are being used to establish a mood they bore the listener and thom yorke could have done himself well to give his old pink floyd and tangerine dream albums a spin before he created this to see how this technique is actually used. atmosphere is a delicate thing like baking a souffl and radiohead yelped while this was in the oven. i find the use of many of these soundscapes to be completely unnecessary. their melodic guitar work along with thom yorkes distinctive vocals give the music a dreamy nature alone and the soundscapes just come off as excess. though in some songs they hit it just right and it comes off pleasant karma police and climbing up the walls but by no means essential to the song. thom yorke voice is a bit well it is certainly distinct let us say that. it will annoy you at first then it will grow on you heck you might even start to like it but it will never become one of those voices you love. you certainly do not want to hear anything a cappella from this man. the alum has some very strong moments even after its clunky start with airbag. paranoid android starts out with a very brooding atmosphere until it eventually explodes into a very enjoyable angsty rocker. exit music and let down are two emotional pieces that listeners on anti-depressants should avoid. but the rest of the album comes off unmemorableno surprises or unlistenabletourist. a prime example of an artist losing its footing and being swept away by experimentation. i feel too many people are hyped into giving this album a five star rating. it certainly has its flaws but it also has its moments. radiohead did better with the bends and its probably best for everyone to start and stay there.,0
mmmmm overrated. great album that is still in the rotation but not 3rd best ever. as with most of their stuff - too self-indulgent. yorke is a very important person in the music world ... to himself ... and this reflected in his increasingly fragmented writing.,0
very fantastic musicianship for the first half of this album and good throughout. i can definitely recommend this album for the music and instrumentation. unfortunately when it comes to the lyrics the emperor has no clothes. subterranean homesick alien has the best lyrics out of everything here. the rest of the lyrics can be enjoyable to sing along with and if i still had time to smoke pot and hang around listening to albums all day long i am sure i could find some deeper meaning of the existential realities of the common pork rind contained within but i do not.,0
strange that everything after karma police is just really bad... those first six songs are 5-star in my book i suppose if you like your psychedelia extremely light and your lyrics infused with just a tinge of sadness this record can do you no wrong.,0
i just listened to okay computer again thinking i had missed something. it still sucks. dull dreary humorless pretentious.,0
well this is an album with the right concept that is the absolute truth but to me it sounds like most other alt. rock albums because of the vocals. if the vocals were done by someone with a different voice or in a different style this could have been a masterpiece. to some people this is the greatest thing in the world to me its just an album with an bad presentation but with a great concept.,0
count me as someone who does not get this. the guitar playing is very nice. drumming is good. the singing is incredibly annoyingly inconsistent. so i cannot enjoy this particularly for the same reason as jeff buckley the smiths oasis etc. the lyrics are ok. songs like karma police would sound a lot better if you handed them to michael stipe or roger waters or maybe even better brad from crash test dummies if you want a more mournful downbeat style. at least most of it is not as annoying as airbag and climbing up the walls. could do without some of the afternoon delight type sound effects on subterranean homesick alien as well. scraping to get it to 3.5 for the instrumentation. no surprises is the best track on here. if i had a headache or close to this gets a 3. the other test of goodness being that there is zero desire to acquire any more radiohead after hearing this. often can be the case for something so obviously mainstream and out there that i have never noticed before. close to best album ever? no way.,0
a mighty opressive treatise on western alienation ok computer did all right here reaching number 21 on the album charts and charting two decent-sized modern rock hits i still hear karma police on the radio from time to time. the playing is tight the pieces fit so well while the band does not sport fantastic guitarists they make the most of the ideas and pedals they brought. paranoid android is a fine example save the unexplained shift to humanmoog lamentation at the 335 mark it is a clinic in merging several concepts into a unified theme. and much as i hate to admit it the lp itself is much the same. glistening yearning pieces like subterranean homesick alien let down and airbag the last too grand for the other tracks but a shocking good opener nonetheless coalesce with forlorn suburban headclutchers like exit music and no surprises. the result is not something i think is particularly relevant or novel oh those machines and the ways they falsely divorce us from our fragility ourselves but if i do not sniff glue should i be talking about the ramones? note though that karma policefitter happier is a one-two self-pitying cod-sarcastic crapfest. note it!,0
a very enjoyable ethereal record...top 10 i do not think so but none the less exceptional!,0
way overrated. the singles are all great and there are some other nice songs but this is not even close to the bends. fitter happier - why?!,0
here is a funny thing - even though i recognised the song no surprises from the first 5 seconds of the intro i never knew what it was called or that it was originally recorded by radiohead. it is beautiful regardless of who wrote it. that does not have anything to do with the main point i want to make i just figured it was a mildly amusing tangent. i just want to say that radiohead quite blatantly pull the trick of building an album around an eps worth of good tracks karma police no surprises fitter happier maybe paranoid android. the rest just sounds like still so much sterile 90s britpop.,0
i do not think the album is perfect but it sure immerses you in an alien universe of its own making for one of the most cohesive sounding albums of the 90s. and i do love the sonic textures in subterranean homesick alien let down and exit music better still is that this trio appears in a row. the rather unbalanced climbing up the walls is definitely also a highlight.,0
i used to hate radiohead. i saw them as boring uninventive and basically mindless crap. however through friends i decided to give this a try to see what all the fuss was about. and i think it is decent but not brilliant. the album starts of magnificently with three outstanding tracks airbag paranoid android and subteranial homesick alien. let down and climbing up walls are both amazing. however the rest of the album is mainly tiresome and dull. though you have to realise the importance of this album. i will not say its overrated just slightly disappointing to what i was expecting. still worth buying though.,0
british music seems to fall into two categories the diy camp that brought us punk and the it came out of art school camp that is clearly the home for radiohead. while ok computer may have been a revelation to 15 year olds anyone who has been listening to music other than standard radio content for any period of time has already heard the styles that are melded together here. so it is not the unique work of art that it was claimed to be. the vocals could be called anguished but to these ears yorke is simply whining for the most part and is the weakest part of the music. also no-one in the band is going to win a best of instrument on any polls in the near future. so much for the down side. ok computer does work. it stands up to repeated listens which is more than most music released today. when yorke does let loose he actually has a decent voice. and the songs dare i call them songs? - the musical pieces are kept interesting by yorkes quirky arrangements obtuse lyrics and use of non-pop sounds. the sum is greater than the parts. an interesting work that is not the saviour of music but does give some tired ears hope in this cookie cutter idol culture.,0
a little too indulgent for me. lucky apart i much prefer the bends.,0
i like the dreamy sound and rifs on the the album.,0
ok i admit it. i just do not get everyone is fascination with radiohead and this album. it is the only radiohead album that i own and -while it does have the occasional good song- it makes me want to kill myself everytime i hear it. a little bit of melancholy is a good thing but radiohead is drowning in a sea of depression. besides all of the depression the vocalist sounds as if he has taken too many darvocets before stepping into the sound booth to cut the vocal tracks. i cannot make out 5 words out of 10 because he slurs so badly. good songs airbag subterranean homesick alien let down and karma police the rest of the album is only good for listening while holding a gun in your mouth.,0
it regularly surprises me how highly this album is generally regarded by fans and critics alike. much of it is really good but i do not think the material is transcendental enough to install ok computer into the annals of the finest popular albums of the modern era. besides the bends is the better album.,0
overrated but there is still enough here to make this their best album. highlights include the spooky climbing up the walls and their tour de force paranoid android. i still say they would be better without the weirdness though...,0
a very strong 3.5 stars what brings it down are fitter happier and the tourist. the other 10 tracks are all at least pretty good with my two favorites being karma police and lucky.,0
i really wish ok computer was a 5 star album for me because i see how it is affected other people and i really do hear the potential for that kind of powerful near-spiritual response. but for me the problem is very simple - i think that airbag through to exit music for a film are all really really great pieces of music and then after than there just is not that much to get me excited. karma police and the tourist are both pretty decent. let down no surprises and lucky are all barely on the good side of passable. climbing up the walls for me is only saved by that insane guitar break midway through. electioneering just kind of bugs me and usually gets skipped. and fitter happier just plain sucks. i feel like i must be missing something here because an album does not get rated this highly by this many people for nothing but i have listened to ok computer dozens of times and this seems to be where i have ended up.,0
couple of great songs karma police no surprises etc but fitter happier??,0
this record is an aural treat. i was coincidentally reading hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and spotted the title to this record. importantly for a band that is so serious most of the time there is some good humor here with fitter happier. tough to take their politics as the cynicism is overly oppressive but of course that is their point and it fires their art.,0
good album but overrated. this computer voice stuff was fun on an amiga-500 20 years ago...,0
i have always remained slightly disappointed with ok computer. to this day ok computer has been the most widely renowned radiohead album only through the accomplishment of granting heavy public appeal. this is what many people think of as radiohead but it remains a decent album at best... although the tourist is one of my favorite songs of all time.,0
i acquired this album about a year ago. from other reviews i gather this was a fairly innovate album when it came out and gained radiohead a substantial reputation and following. i can see why but i have mixed feelings about this offering. the good multilayered sound with an original blend of instrumentsnoises used in interesting ways. progressive rock stuff for the 90s. excellent. the bad the lead vocals. the lead singer is certainly an acquired taste. the diction is poor and without the written lyrics it would be very hard to know exactly what is being sung. if there had been a different singer or even no singer! i am sure i would have enjoyed this album more and probably given it 4.5 stars. i have a feeling this album would grow on you the more you listened to it. i have listened to it right through about 5 times now over the months i have had it and each time i have enjoyed it a little more. the vocals still grate though.,0
a nice collection of moody brooding guitar pop. karma police is quite stunning and there are a few other great moments. even though some of the songs are kind of weak,0
this radiohead album never moved me.. it is too over complicated in nonsence layers of angst that it loses it is appeal quickly for me as does the booklet artwork. phyically i dislike alot of the music on here because it is much to loud in an over produced way yorkes voice is as irritating as ever.. i do not regard him as a good vocal over the soundtrack that radiohead  paints.. i am not saying this cd is bad.. by no means.. any album that gets heaps of praise.. cannot be bad?.. today in late 2002 ok computer seems like windows 95 - inventive but boring... it is no dark side of the moon... i think oks sales talk for themselves. it is all been done before and better but without the gloss.,0
i really feel like i am getting myself into trouble giving this album 2.5 stars. but every time i listen to it i start to feel physically ill by about track 5. now i am not being metaphorical i am not insulting radioheads music at all. on the level i feel ill. maybe i will give the chicken kebab a miss next time i plan on listenin to it,0
an ok album with one great song but i must say that this is not exactly my kind of fortey.,0
i had to listen to this as i was recommended it and it gets great reviews all of the time. well its ok for elevator music. pleasant enough but nothing to grab my interest for very long. paranoid android is probably my favourite. sounds a bit like coldplay to me. i must be missing something.,0
wow  following up dark side of the moon does not really bare thinking about but floyd somehow managed it and this time fused together words that were full of sadness for the fate of their old leader syd barrett as well as a fierce critique of the music industry. musically speaking its not as stunning as its predecessor . have a cigar sung by roy harper is basically a lesser version of money . welcome to the machine is better and aided by some superbly eerie synthesisers . shine on is the key track full of stunning transitions and moods gilmours guitar playing some of his finest. but the second sequence at the end of the record undoubtedly loses its way . that leaves wish you were here  the groups most beautifulheartbreaking song . that its subject syd barrett should turn up at the studio out the blue after a 7 year self imposed exile whilst this album was being recorded virtually unrecognisable and hugely overweight - moving roger waters to tears is freaky in the extreme . god knows what it must have done to the group.,0
the only reason i have this album on my computer is because years ago my father wanted me to make him a few copies from his cd for some friends or enemies!. i did not delete it as i wanted to know what the fuss with pink floyd was. like everyone ever i had heard some of their songs but i did not think anything of them. i had probably heard dark side of the moon by this point too but it was very much meh as far as i was concerned. wish you were here is doubtlessly a better album but that does not really mean a lot. my ratings for the two vary by 0.5 stars and really my rating is largely for shine on you crazy diamond which is pretty impressive and deserves a good deal of merit although the other tracks are alright or at least welcome to the machine is pretty good anyway. reading the reviews here is amusing. it seems everyone else pretty much orgasms over stuff like this i was going to take my sexual analogy a lot further than that but it was a tad too uncomfortable to type. i am happy to keep this as the only pink floyd album i possess although diehard fans can tell me i am wrong if they so desire.,0
i was sleepy once. must have been about 3 am. decided to pass out with music on. nothing works better than this narcolepsy-inducing tripe.,0
people seem to like these pink floyd fellas a little too much...,0
again i struggle here with pink floyds massive artistic ego which seems to convince them they can get away with writing four songs and puffing it all out into a full-length album. lazy lazy lazy. to me this is a shame as any band should be able to come up with a few more songs than that. having said that most of the songs here are outstanding obviously the title track is a classic and it is also one of my favourites of all time. however i simply cannot give this album more stars because they fail to deliver the content i am looking for when i buy an album. listening to the same song for thirteen minutes twice! just does not cut it for me.,0
wish you were here was a british reality tv show that first aired in 1974. the premise of the show was to take people to exotic places that they could never afford to go on their own to see things in between the hairy legs of the world where a spread of bountiful secrets would be unlocked to them in all due course. my mother was a real fan of this show which began to die in the late 90s the theme tune was wonderful but unfortunately the show ended when the presenter was shot. the world stood still no longer able to shine on a human had departed from the world as one of the greatest contributors to something with the name wish you were here. or had she? yes...why would not she? pink floyds obvious but probably would deny plagiarism of this title will be ignored for the rest of the review they clearly would not care for such things and i would quite not like to get flagged as off topic by rhian again. yes rhian i know...i know... a lot of people make a large statement on how this is so so so much greater than dark side of the buttock. while i agree it is certainly better i think the results were more pleasuring simply because they did not go into full on song rape and did not chord themselves to death with plagal shit. shine on... has some fantastic guitar melodies although they are hardly the most imaginative or creative things to have been created they have enough viscosity and expression to carry the whole piece through a quiet accompaniment and synth-biz crunch. even by the time we finally reach the pub-screaming chorus it does not give any cringing disgust. it sounds nice and pleasing and just drives by like a next door neighbour found the best burger bar in town. i can hardly critique their timing if you dislike the length of the solo then i would stop listening now. i invented a time portal that can rotate. it makes me think of how queen would sound if we slowed down the hook and added an additional synth sound with less melodramatic vocals. which sounds pretty meh on paper but turned up it manages to ooze in like trifle as a slow sax solo fiddles with the toffee...only to go on for a little too long. i am 14 and i fuckin love this album 3 so fuck you if you thought id like nicki minaj and what ever that shit is youtube is fucking amz. welcome to the machine takes a slightly different vibe but maintains fluency. less guitar wank and more constipated vocals. to be honest i like this track better it seems to have more purpose and emotions that i can empathise with as i am constipated a lot of the time but i can understand why this does not have the same glaring popularity as shine on.... it kind of sounds at times like a cheesey commercial trying to sell me toilet paper in the 80s and i certainly would have loved that advertisement to my closest clutched intents. but i do not need no man on that!!! the melodies in this song seem way better arranged and not just a pentatonic slur of mapped solos that the other song was but they were saved with brilliant playing. it feels stronger and gappier and o like. i could listen to this way more times than i could listen to a pizza hut or a chicken wing. chicken wings have that little crunch to them that throws away the substance while this is chucking pills upon pills of angsty synths and phrased out acoustic guitar chords. it is a part. then there is a song about cigars which is quite clearly a post-modern complex symbolism of the detrimental effects of burning holes into typewriter quills. the synth line is pretty catchy but i find the song in general quite annoying. something i would consider proto-annoying ringtone. and i know that is harsh but i met a guy once and he had the most arsey ringtones ever and they would sound exactly like this. a song underneath a drone of synth and was often about something cigar shit. ridin the gravy train. i mean it is pretty groovy i guess...i just want a reason not to like it. because i believe i do not the vocals make me think of sausages or something. in fact i will let you decide why i dislike this. probably will not change why you like this seeing as you are man enough to read a review about an album you have already heard...yes who hast not heard such a thus album thou? thee? theresa guitar solo is nice an all...buxom cute with the bass in the trunk. yeah the arrangements just do nothing for me but i see why people like this. it is somewhat drug psyche-meh-in-dah whole picture in a way that is prague that city in czech republic land. it ends with some panning shit. wish you were here is also very pood and i like the general build up it achieves in this which other songs here have to do in 2 billion minutes. once again the guitar playing is word synonymous to good but is let down by annoyingly arsey lyrics. it reminds me of free bird by that band and then it is like wefhufehifhui and ends with a wave of southern fried wank. it gets to this point however when i feel they ought to have expanded their synth sounds a little. i know it might be asking a little too much in the 70s but i am aware for a fart that for a millionaire band like this they could have afforded at least a second set of mellotron tapes. maybe one with choirs...or sine wave!!! the reprise with the shine on... is also alright i guess. i do not know probably was expecting something else but it ends it all rather well. i like how the bass is all wonga wonga as the synth does its whole blanga blanga shiz until they repeat the pub chorus quite nicely again. i mean overall...i preferred the show. i know i know just because she dead does not mean she better but it just had a superior premise and was more to the point. this album is saved by absolute professionalism that seems to overshadow their creative side a lot more. gilmour is an amazing guitar player but does not seem to use this ability in his composing power and let us it falter into the trap of being a good player over a good inventor. you can make the best toast in the world but that does not make you a quality chef the prog cliches of course are in full force which kind of have a major marmite effect on whether you will loatheve this album or not. welcome to the machine is still a fanfuck of a song though and i do recommend this album as a listen to real floyd heads. it flows brilliantly and i see it being more deserving than dark side as it manages to seem much more entertaining than that without resorting to symbolism and harmonic gimmickry. it is fuller better and has more bounce. like a breast.,0
not a huge pink floyd fan but after revisiting wish you were here this is so obviously the bands shining diamond in their beloved storied discography. this may be the most classic most timeless effort they have made. just listen to parts 1-5 of shine on you crazy diamond. i am not a 70s expert but is there another band that sounds like this? glistening ambient music that does not bore the mind. all these production tricks that really tricks up on ya. the songwriting coming from a simple idea but exaggerated and jammed out in pink floyds repertoire. a solid ass album. it is only rated lower because of replay value but still fye.,0
this album while having interesting ideas i found to be a slog to get through. it feels like 40 minutes of the same damn song. i would listen to dark side of the moon or atomic heart mother over this album any day.,0
it is strange to think that if radiohead never released ok computer -this- of all albums would be the highest rated album on this website. i like this album alright but it is an odd thing to consider. when i was 1213 this was a favorite album of mine as i was really first exploring music then 10 years later i performatively gave this album an 0.5 on here and called it poop because i had just found out who can were or whatever  felt entitled to a being a dickhead about music stage that people on here who do not like me think i am still in. now over 10 years after that i am making an attempt to reconcile these two past positions of mine by revisiting it. musically this thing is pretty solid for commercial prog rock  the lyrics on the title track are good but damn these lyrics elsewhere are so bad - what exactly are they complaining about that the head of some record company did not actually know who they were? they were still making money hand over fist who gives a fuck. sensitive babies. the title track is a great song and the instrumental portions of all the songs are just fine. it really only stinks when you notice how much of the lyrics are just talking about nothing important.,0
01-02-2022 wish you were here arranca con las primeras 5 partes de shine on you crazy diamond que a mi parecer tarda algo en empezar ya que los primeros minutos me parecen muy redundantes pero cuando entran los riffs de guitarra es cuando todo se pone interesante la cancion dura 12 minutos y al igual que las demas canciones del album la duracion es algo que juega en su contra la mayoria del tiempo. welcome to the machine tiene una melodia de voz y delivery bastante raro no me gusto pero debo admitir que el puente de la cancion es interesante al igual que los sintetizadores que llegan a inundar la cancion. have a cigar debe ser la cancion mas groovy y funky del album y a decir verdad se siente como un respiro fresco dentro de los primeros 20 minutos del album donde ya se nos habia llenado de este rock progresivo lento y medio tedioso. las lineas de bajo de waters se lucen en la mayoria de los temas al igual que los solos de gilmour aunque debo admitir que no soy tan fan de su voz. wish you were here el tema mas popular de pink floyd suena muy bien junto a todo el contexto del album es una cancion muy emotiva y catchy con momentos preciosos bastante memorables se sabe que es un maldito himno. todo termina con las partes 6 a 9 de shine on you crazy diamond que a pesar de tener casi la misma duracion que las primeras partes me parecio menos pesada que su predecesora y puedo decir que me gust mas me parecio un buen cierre del album se siente nostalgico como deberia ya que el tema central del album segun dicen es syd barret y sus problemas entonces para ser algo tan delicado puedo decir que el grupo supo canalizar todo lo que sentan y entregaron un gran album. calificacion 8 canciones favoritas shine on you crazy diamond 1-5 have a cigar wish you were here shine on you crazy diamond 6-9 canciones menos favoritas welcome to the machine,0
at the time of writing i am the 1000th review for this album. that is why i wrote this review. i do not particularly like pink floyd i guess i have never been high enough while listening to them. this albums alright but whatever i would just listen to radiohead or something.,0
 ,0
if you think dsotm is better than this you are fucking delusional,0
two great parts of shine on you crazy diamond and some unimpressive and vapid fillers in between. however this album as a whole is still more interesting than anything the man to whom it was dedicated did.,0
the title track sounds like a melody so they chose it right. if the stuff is really out of my grasp like rihanna its a 30 but i dont think this applies. pink floyds my defifinition of not understanding.,0
pink floyd are one of those bands i have a tough time approaching. as of writing this review i have heard 3 floyd albums this one animals and part of dark side. this album while good is nowhere near good enough to explain the hype for me. it is obvious why they are popular however. their sound is very distinct yet formulaic and their lyrics can relate to a large audience. but getting back onto the album itself what makes it just ok in my opinion? let us start with the first track shine on you crazy diamond. it is fine i guess. typical rock guitar structures and some admittedly hard hitting lyrics centering around syd barrett. then we get to my favorite track welcome to the machine. the sound of this song in particular really intrigues me and is probably the sole reason i would want to listen to this again. the bass synths and the echoing guitar make for one chilling track. honestly i completely forgot what the other songs sounded like. i recall have a cigar having a noticeably more bluesy sound to it and nothing else. so my verdict? eh. not great but not horribly offensive. i guess king crimson kind of corrupted my taste in prog rock because floyd just sounds too glamorous to me. if you like glam and prog rock however it will not hurt to check this out.,0
is it good? yeah it is good. i like it. is it the 2nd greatest piece of music ever made??? ehhhhhh. i would not even say it is the second best pink floyd album. overrated and overhyped but still amazing synths play a huge part in this and it works perfect with roger waters bass and voice. an absolute must-listen.,0
sonically brilliant but some of the production has not aged well. the middle 3 tracks are perfect. they are truly thrilled to listen to. wish you were here is a touching tribute that still holds its own. the opening tracks are not too long as some may complain. i just find the guitar shrieking and bending and the strange synthshorns are really meh. i do not know the vocals are amazing throughout i just cannot get behind certain parts of the sound. all that said i appreciate its significance and for all my plights its worst tracks are still leagues ahead of most songs put out today.,0
i am sorry. i wanted to like this more. i really did. i. . . do not actually have much to say on the matter. i can recognize this as quality music but my god it takes so long to get where it is going. again there is something hereand when you actually get to hear it it really is quite goodbut it is buried in plodding nothingness. in jazz the central concept is that of tension and releasethat is you can pretty much play anything after anything if you commit to it enough and your brain will eventually just make up the logical pathway to connect them which is why music theory is so descriptive and not prescriptive. the thing is there is not really that tension herebarely a diatonic tritone throughout the middle three songsand so that release comes at no real cost. and yes i get that that is kind of the point but that does not make it any more interesting of a listening experience. the clip of   pyotr tchaikovskys symphony no.4 had me hopeful though. i do not knowi guess this one is not for me. the dark side of the moon is still great though.,0
from interplanetary sunsets showering onto plugged machines wish you were here is an aerial perspective of roger waters eulogy to late band-member syd barrett. a melodramatic meltdown into synthetic servitude. for an everlasting album with only five tracks strangely enough it fills out forty-four whole minutes. though pink floyd is notorious for those dragged-dirt guitar solos and it certainly shines here. and knowing how muddle-headed the band is throughout the community you either love it or hate it. pink floyd is no stranger to dimmed-out albums that stretch an opera so far you lather in it the dark side of the moon on the flip-side this paean has definite dips. welcome to the machine and have a cigar carry-out the continued sound of shine on you crazy diamond pts. 1-5 but they seem so clashing compared to the softer compositions like the latter compilation. all parts of shine on you crazy diamond and wish you were here are the definite highlights of this golden oldie.,0
this whole album was dull. i could not stand a second without skipping ahead. i do not understand the reviews this album gets. wish you were here is pretty overrated dsotm is also boring.,0
pink floyd is just one of those bands you either completely dig them or you just do not get the exaggerated fanfare around their work. i myself belong to the latter camp. other than the short longing title track the rest of this is just...well long. too long and that is why this record for the most part gets boring fast. also welcome to the machine might be the most redundant pink floyd song ever.,0
this is simply one of the tritest and most vapid things i have ever heard. it is just fine. none of these musical ideas are interesting and definitely not worthy of the record-space that is given to them. do not pull the it is old card on me either because this is 1975. red by king crimson was released the previous year. i mean jesus yes had already released 3 albums that are better than this. the only reason this is not a 25 is because it is not unpleasant or anything. but i could not imagine sitting down to listen to this again. this is an album about nothing and it sounds like nothing. in one ear and out the other.,0
i can appreciate the talent and effort that went in this album but i am sick of hearing its better tracks from overexposure. shine on you crazy diamond and wish you were here make me cringe when i hear their choruses. i envy the future generations who will not be flogged with this album so they can properly enjoy it.,0
never has such an expertly-produced album also been so uninteresting to me. i wish i could understand what people hear in anything except the opener and the title track.,0
this album really does not do a lot for me. the whole of shine on you crazy diamonds is really solid when there is actually something going on but for its 26 minute run time more than half the album almost 15 of those minutes there is next to nothing going on. i enjoy instrumental bits when they add to the atmosphere of an album but that is not what is happening here. there is nothing i dislike more in music than wasting time and there is a lot of that between these two songs. welcome to the machine is okay but it does not justify lasting nearly eight minutes and does not do anything special. have a cigar is one of more diverse sounding songs on the record. i am not a big fan of the lyrics but it sounds cool so i will not hate on it too hard. the title track is far and away the standout of the album. none of its five minutes are wasted and it only leaves me wishing the whole album sounded like this. my rating for this album is based almost entirely in the more critical aspects the instrumentation and singing mainly. personally not an album that makes me want to relisten. the album art is cool as hell though favorite tracks wish you were here rating light to decent 7,0
welcome to the machine and have a cigar really drag this one down from great to just good.,0
this is part of a series of my reviews on the band. i have reviewed all pre-1980 non-soundtrack albums and the reviews should be read in order. part of a stretch of very overrated pink floyd albums. this one features some higher highs than the dark side of the moon though it also features lower lows. the final floyd album which i enjoy. shine on you crazy diamond 1-5 is a beautiful long track that i will not cover here. it is very good. welcome to the machine and have a cigar are bad. they both have the same themes oppression from labels within the music industry. conceptually they could be good but in my opinion neither track works well in execution. rhythmically they feel quite empty. the vocals i can only describe as annoying. wish you were here is a track of longing. the vocals and the guitar are very sweet and pair well together. shine on you crazy diamond6-9 is also great. like the earlier section i will not cover it here. listen to it. this album like i mentioned is the last pink floyd album that i enjoy. that is not to say that this is a peak by any means but rather that it is truly all down hill from here. if only it was not for the second and third track perhaps i would enjoy it more.,0
wish you were here 1975 by pink floyd is very similar to the original suite but made up of different instruments and settings with much different sounds including floating candles. it is also very different in its use of a tremolo and string patterns so it should not be confused with the lp recording. the suite is often misidentified as tron by film-music fans though the films plot had the main characters having become obsessed with a colorful computer game it was later revealed that the other characters were actually kind robots. the piano concerto no. 2 by mozart is often mistaken for this even though it had no actual piano accompaniment whatsoever. wish you were here 1975 by pink floyd is not a movie so much as a collection of musical scores recorded over a period of several days in a studio by jazz legends miles davis and herbie hancock arranged by warren cowan and some singers including the legendary john coltrane. it is a video essay in the classic sense centered on the two groundbreaking sessions the assembly of the pre-album work that would become the album and the introduction of audience composer peter paul  mary 1996 during the final days of the sessions. in conclusion wish you were here is the perfect record for people like me who are always interested in the politics of gender and sexuality but have never held a trans person in their real-life hands. unholy,0
reviewing and rating albums that played such a big part in your formative years is a strange thing. there is literally hundreds of albums that i like lots more - that mean a lot more to me - than this does but this and let us say master of puppets and a bunch of other canonical rock albums is totally ingrained in my being more than any of those other better and more important albums ever will be. i know every note of this not one moment is a surprise to me i can learn nothing more from this. but it still sounds really good to me and i cannot give it a less than good rating.,0
after months retracing the steps of pink floyd left before dark side of the moon i finally make it onto the other sides wake. am i better off after only having discovered one rewarding album atom heart mother? given the clear ascension in talent and substance a testament to ones artistic growth i would say yes. in many ways wish you were here picks up where dark side of the moon left off centering a concept around ones mental enigma. here it is directed at former pink floyd member syd barrett and his mental breakdown depicted quite breathtakingly on the cover. wish you were here and more precisely the bookended shine on you crazy diamond cherish those who have endured the perils of mental instability with capricious theatrics and thought-provoking lyrics performed by roger waters. given the climate of the times i am reviewing this album in 2019 the handling of mental health as an honorable affliction to experience is admirable. unfortunately waters attempted to shoehorn a secondary concept into wish you were here which on the surface aimed to provide backstory to barretts breakdown but under thinly-veiled layers mocked the music industry through the eyes of a cantankerous individual. a concept that i would not mind normally but given the concept feels unjustified and lackluster. certainly not as coherent and thorough as dark side of the moons. these moments do wear down welcome to the machine and have a cigar but only lyrically for the musical elements still adhere to pink floyds textbook mannerisms. which reach an all-time high here. i see why progressive rock fanatics foam over wish you were here. the instrumental segments are monstrous epics spoiled with rich nuance and ear-warming jazz. at times they linger a tad too long for my liking seen especially on what is essentially shine on you crazy diamonds remix pts. 6-9. normally i would not mind a reprise but only 18 minutes separates the pieces so it does not feel warranted or all that impactful. elsewhere the first minute of welcome to the machine essentially kickstarted industrial music to the masses and is easily pink floyds greatest field recording element. while the song does not reach the innovative highs set early on it still carries the ominous hopeless atmosphere to a satisfying culmination. absolutely nothing beats the title track though that is something almost everyone agrees on. like welcome to the machines cutting-edge opening wish you were here starts with a short television sample unheard of in the mid 1970s. however things take a more folk rock route here drawing similarities to the underrated middle portion of atom heart mother. the evolution of wish you were here and waters lovely vocals take the shockingly non-single to unfathomable heights though and really should have been the conclusion to wish you were here.,0
soundtrack to paint drying. well recorded.,0
got to sayi am not crazy about shine on you crazy diamond. it is fine in a pinch. the core three songs i could listen to ad infinitum  have a cigar boasting one of the most dazzling chord progressions in rock. shine on you crazy diamond fools me for jamming though i realize that it was consciously structured in the studio.,0
this album is a very sweet album as it serves as a tribute to syd barrett. the keyboards as well as the other instrumentals are very melancholy when the album discusses syd and his descent into madness. pink floyd reflected on why their former band mate fell off and the band is definitely more vulnerable because of this album. the first theme of the album syd barrett is done rather well but the second theme of the vices of fame and capitalism is not quite as well executed. the lyrics get lacklustre on tracks like welcome to the machine which come off as preachy but not relatable. although the album does redeem itself with the anti-music label theme on have a cigar especially with the guest vocalist which is a nice touch. the flow between tracks is there but it is not as creative as i would have hoped. the flow between themes is non-existent which is my main problem with this album. the two themes are mentioned but they do not mesh together very well. i feel this album could have emphasized the because-and-effect relationship of fame and syds madness a lot more and through that could have been a far more cohesive album. pink floyd felt pressured to make an album at this time and they felt discombobulated with their loss of syd barrett and their growing fame and demand from the music industry and it shows through this album. although this album is solid with good music and stellar production i wish it had more thematic cohesion and less vague preaching. with all that said it is a great tribute to syd barrett which made me smile and watch as pink floyd said goodbye to their former band mate and old friend.,0
sad that this is widely considered their best work. pf have made some absolute classics bursting with personality - from piper to meddle and dark side and animals - i do not know why anyone would listen to this album that drags its feet so much and rehashes a lot of ideas that they already did in a much more interesting way. this album seems like a prime example of a band becoming too famous and iconic to have to actually try to make interesting music anymore. soycd is a great lullaby,0
no doubt better than the dire dark side of the moon pink floyd return to the more thematic music of some of their earlier works echoes say. the opening of shine on you crazy diamond is quite nice. with the rock overture of part two the assembled individuals actually sound like a group. the segue into the vocals is effective. and the lyrics while not subtle at least attempt a fitting tribute to barrett. they manage to get 25 minutes out of the one song by splitting it in two. this is the very definition of milking a musical idea. what else can i say that is positive? i enjoy the vcs 3 at the start of machine setting up a nice pulse. the groove of have a cigar is serviceable and roy harper delivers the lines well. i like the way wish you were here starts with a guitar line that seems to emulate another from some lost recording. but no two of the songs seem to come from the same record. thematically this record retreads familiar ground. welcome to the machine worries over the corporatisation of.... no it is a warning against technology... no it is... let us face it any political message pink floyd might muster is incoherent. even worse is have a cigar the epitome of songs on which fantastically spoiled rock stars complain about all their money. just fuck right off.,0
ditch welcome to the machine and have a cigar and release the rest as a shorter lp you have got gold here. the under-cooked tracks in the middle are as bland as can be and highlight my biggest issue with pink floyd-- everyone there was very talented but their work lacked any sort of spirit. i do not feel passion in their work but i do believe they were all passionate musicians.,0
de enformiga och tysta partierna verkar sga mycket mer till mnga lyssnare n vad man kan hra i musiken. tyvrr hr jag bara enformighet och tystnad.,0
this album would be a lot better without synthesizers. a lot better.,0
admittedly this album is more honest and less tawdry than dark side of the moon but where it succeeds in achieving what can be seen as the bare minimum of artistry it fails as a piece in and of itself. there are certainly times when the album is listenable and enjoyable but in the same respect that dsotm sacrificed artistry for listenability wish you were here sacrifices listenability for artistry. nobody needs nearly 20 minutes of an album that sounds indistinguishable on its own. sure there are 1213 minute songs that have merit being that long but the sonic journey of shine on you crazy diamond is lost in the pretension of itself. if the piece had been condensed to its essentials it would easily improve the album while sacrificing very little of the supposed artistry it touts. ultimately it serves as a lesson for all other musicians do not make music that does nothing for the sake of making an artsy song it is long and unnecessary nobody enjoys it except for psuedo-intellectuals such as yourself.,0
essentially four songs that would go on to dominate airwaves the world over pink floyd stubbornly imprison themselves in the studio determined to create something fresh sonically striking and linked by a single theme to captivate the minds of curious listeners. all four songs are scatter-shot with the sexy blues bends of gilmour and thankfully only the openercloser tribute to syd directly recalls dark side particularly parrys gripping saxophone solo. the absence of clare torrys formless wailing may be the albums biggest plus. welcome to the machine is wildly original keyboards and clean guitars creating the highest high drama. no drums pulsing keyboards... moustache-era meets the space age. the funky riff and sci-fi keys of have a cigar mesh wells with roy harpers yelps and croons and wish you were here has become the ultimate wave-your-lighter campfire song seemingly more popular each year. the machine-like sucked-into-the-void interludes and other studio tricks along with the uncomplicated anti-music-business leitmotif make for one of the more intelligent rock records of the 1970s. it is my favorite floyd record and while i respect the art the pedigree of the players even the artwork - i always seem to reject it outright. i really tried to enjoy it this time adding it to my regular rotation both in the car and by the turntable. total number of plays in two months zero. just a flavor of a food that i do not enjoy and this counts for everything in how i rank an album.,0
let me see if i can explain this using a sandwich metaphor because that is what this album feels like a weird and not very good sandwich. let us say i am in the pink floyd restaurant. there is a new sandwich everyone is been talking about the wish you were here sandwich. i am getting sick of the dark side burger and i am feeling risky today so i order it. the plate comes to my table and the first thing i notice is the big-ass slices of bread. these are of course the shine on suites. they are a bit hard to tackle and overwhelming but at least they keep everything inside from falling out of place. it is the first thing my teeth sink into and i am hooked. they are sweet but have a bitter aftertaste. under the top slice is welcome to the machine which in this metaphor is a burned piece of lettuce. it is weird and robotic and i am wondering why it is in the sandwich. it is probably one of those new food trends that is clearly trying to be something more than it really is. i can kind of slide out the remains of the lettuce from the sandwich so i am going to ignore it and keep eating. have a cigar is... wait what is this? it is another burned piece of lettuce. this one is even more burned than the last. what the fuck? why the hell are there two burned slices of lettuce? i ask the waiter if this is right there is no way there are supposed to be two slices of lettuce. he says no that is the way the chef made it. he explains chef floyd is a little distracted by losing his sous chef barrett so i keep eating. finally we get to the meat of the sandwich. it is juicy enough to make me forget about the weird lettuce parts i have discarded onto my plate. i do not know how meat can taste sweet like this but it kind of works. clearly this is what everyone is raving about. i could probably eat this all day but i would probably get sick of it. and then i am already at the end of the sandwich. that is it? i mean the bread was great and the meat was tasty-- a little too sweet. but i mean what the fuck were those two pieces of lettuce? i will translate this back into music reviewing because i am getting tired of this metaphor. have a cigar and welcome to the machine both have the same dumb message do not trust the music industry!! not only do they not fit in with the rest of the bittersweet nature of the album but they also kind of suck. gilmour and harpers strained vocals yelling about poisoning real music or something. it is no wonder these are the tracks written solely by waters. they are preachy and not very interesting musically. the synth of welcome is cool and the ending solo of cigar is pretty cool but neither save either of these tracks from waters hit-you-over-the-head style. shine on and the title track are great but i think people forget two of pink floyds least enjoyable songs are also on this album. perfect for getting lost in the celestial shine on suite and pretending the rest of the album does not exist,0
wish you were here is for the most part taken up by the song shine on you crazy diamond. a 26 minute tribute to former friend and bandmate syd barrett. it is divided into nine parts and split into two halves one to begin the album one to end it. syd had taken too many drugs and went crazy so the band mourned the effective loss and expressed it in the song. the result is a near masterpiece filled with dense emotion and weaving atmospheres. it starts with a synth playing long and ambient minor chords setting a dramatic and solemn tone. with delicate synth and slide guitar soloing over it the chords underneath have a stillness and gravity that really effectively set up the magnitude of the piece. in part two those chords fade out and the famous four notes unofficially named syds theme hit. they are played in isolation a few times between tense pauses before the band joins in. this moment to me is a perfect representation for the theme of the song. the chord is ambiguous as you are not sure of its musical context. it ends on an e note which is not part of the g minor scale. this makes those four notes dramatic but also mysterious. the starkness adds a sense of importance like everyone should turn their heads toward it. it keeps playing the drums build up and the band explodes into a c chord right as that final e note plays revealing it as the major 3rd. it then gives the theme a direct and celebratory sound. this sense of clarity and unison is the band reconnecting with syd as they knew him and paying him tribute. it really opens the piece up and it is a great introduction of what is to come. the sorrow continues with the synth and guitar soloing. there is a really cool moment where the band stops and sustains and you think vocals are going to start. the lead guitar then just comes back in with heightened intensity like it just was not finished expressing its sadness. by the time the vocals finally do come it feels rather revealing. as if you just saw someone cry for twenty minutes and they actually start talking. the lyrics are about the man losing his way and his touch with reality using similes and metaphors. when the vocals erupt in the shine on you crazy diamond refrain it feels like a distraught but accepting farewell. like they are ceremonially releasing this old friend they know will never come back. syds theme then returns for part five but this time transitioning to a subdued and jazzy sax solo. i think it represents syds relatively neutral state of mind. it seems detached from the other parts in its mood with a slight night club vibe to it. it feels a little out of place but it is a nice way to lightened the load after the heaviness of the first four parts. the following song is welcome to the machine. it is about the machine that is the music industry. the pulsing synths do a good job at evoking a big and intimidating machine but overall the song is too overblown. coming after a truly harrowing tune about a beloved friend losing his mind greedy business men having too much control seems like a relatively trivial subject matter to dramatize. i do not disagree with the sentiment but the loud acoustic strums and constant strained vocals just sound melodramatic. gilmore and waters sing together and they have a constant intensity that seems almost gothic when paired with the industrial synths. the synths do sound fantastic on a technical level the whole album has top notch production and the song takes you to a unique place. it is just not a place i can care much about. the song would have probably worked better as an instrumental. the next song have a cigar has a nice groovy instrumental but i do not like the vocals. roy harper is the singer and i am not sure why he is singing other than that he was recording in the same building as pink floyd and they were friends. the singing does not elevate the music at all. the sound once again is huge and the synth riff is booming but the vocals and lyrics fall short. the words are a mocking of the typical clueless music industry guy who cares only of the bottom line. the jokey and sarcastic tone does not fit with the big commanding instrumental. there is not a coherent rhyme scheme and overall it just sounds kind of lazy. roy harpers voice sounds pretty similar to waters and gilmore further posing the question of why he is singing it. i do not know if the two band members would have made the song much better but i think waters would have more effectively conveyed the bitter attitude. the guitar solo at the end is the best part with david gilmore at his most loose just wailing over the cool rhythm. this song again would have probably worked better as an instrumental at least for me. things get back on track as the syd theme returns with wish you were here. the intro is a perfect metaphor of the meaning of the song. far in the distance you hear the main guitar line play and in front and center comes some lead guitar playing sad simple melodies over it. the sense of distance with the lead guitar being here and the accompaniment that it is playing to being far away really encompasses the title. the song itself is another tribute to syd barrett but this time the strain is gone and it is just a simple expression of sadness. like some afternoon he thought of him and had a momentary period of sorrow and introspection. the song has one of the most infectious and recognizable acoustic riffs out there and is really poignant in its simplicity. the album ends with part two of shine on you crazy diamond. this time the synth and guitar soloing parts 6 and 8 with a verse in between have a spacey and driving atmosphere. the waning and bending of the lead synth and slide guitar give a really cool sense of unease. it is still high in emotion but not the blatant sadness it was before. it all ends part 9 on a slow note with the synth playing a whimpering solo. the instrumental just trudges along giving it all an air of dejected acceptance. the major chord at the very end has a sweet optimism like it just remembered that it is making a tribute to the man not just lamenting his loss. overall this is sort of an uneven album. even though the two lesser songs only take up under a third of the record it feels like it is more. the decision to split shine on you crazy diamond in two was a controversial one within the band but because it was too long to fit on one side it had to be done. i think it would have been better had it been all together as a continuos and concise piece. 3.55,0
excited from reviews and it being determined by the rym charts as 2nd greatest album of all i have to say this listening was one hell of a let down. welcome to the machine and have a cigar are songs i would never willingly spend my time on again. the shine on you crazy diamond complete set could absolutely be worse but i do not see how it would be more interesting than any other masterpieces in any aspect more than any album a band has made the previous decade of its original release. wish you were here reminds me of a bob dylan song in a way and i do not like bob dylan smuch but i do like that song and it is probably the best on the album. i may have missed something about the sound only being able to stream it on spotify and not get something lossless but nothing about its pace flow or rhythm really excite me or because me to feel anything torwards it and it probably does not help that i never really grew up listening to syd barrets music at all. anyways objectively i just cannot see how this is considered one of the best albums of all time by this world. to summarize if i had a choice to get a single of careful with that axe eugene vs. this entire lp for the same price at same condition i would probably have to go with the single.,0
this whole album is basically a collection of well thought out slow jam sessions with different instruments. i am not particularly fond of the hookclimax of the songs it is pretty cheesy at times. i do not know how to explain why i do not like it that much. it just does not feel like there is much to talk about. it is very barebones and boring in comparison to other pink floyd albums. i do like the transition from have a cigar to wish you were here a lot it is just so classic. the criticism of the music industry topic that takes up welcome to the machine and have a cigar has been done a million times maybe this album was one of the first to do it. shrug emoji,0
pretty solid album. out of the pink floyd albums i have heard it definitely sounds like the saddest which makes sense i guess because it is dedicated to syd. i feel like welcome to the machine was the low point. it just felt like it dragged a little to me. the title track is great and have a cigar is also pretty good. both parts of shine of you crazy diamond are good though i feel 6-9 also starts to drag a little towards the end. overall good album though i think the dark side of the moon is a little better.,0
the crazy diamond tracks are p cool. the multiple sections all flow into each other to make something cohesive. fucking obviously. i am just saying that i like it. and the title track is pretty emotional and shit. i do not know. i really do not have much to say about this album. how is this 5 of all time on this website? why do people like this shit so much? why do you like it so much al huh? part of rymasters volume one i journey through alrogs top 100 albums abandoned,0
first one absolutely bangs. fucking pure james caan showdown in thief vibes. vocals come in late and nearly ruin the whole thing. cannot hack pink floyd lyricsvocals. takes me out of it. they will have some really ahead of their time instrumentally sound going on and then yer da comes in and ruins it chatting about stupid shite on the vocals again. second has some interesting synths going on but once again more vocals. we do not need them! this whole thing though is a lot more musically interesting than i remember. have a cigar sounds like one of the generic background rock tunes they did on the wall. it does not do all that much for me. it is not terrible by an means just kind of there. wish you were here is a classic of course. a little cringey and overplayed. it comes like that family campfire song but it is kind of nice so i will allow it. final tracks kind of like the first but not as good. has like a funky section though that almost becomes dudes rock but is ruined by that absolute dad just going shine on you crazy diamond. just shut up and make it instrumental.,0
wish you were here by pink floyd is the album proceeding the dark side of the moon an album which had smashed the charts. like dsotm the album flows very coherently even more perfectly than it is predecessor in fact. it is low number of longer songs aids this aspect of the album. another way in which this album is superior to the dark side of the moon is in it is greater humanity. shine on you crazy diamond and the title track wish you were here are both relieving suites of sympathy to hear after the psychedelicprog abstract exercises in the likes of dsotm and meddle. final verdict 710 will listen to on occasion 3.5 stars,0
i am absolutely mystified how a this could be classified as prog rock. with the endless plodding noodling it is closer to elevator music or smooth jazz. nothing progressive happens in any of the 45 minutes. how can this be in the same chart as can or even yes? b this lethargic yet surprisingly lightweight album could somehow garner so many 5-star ratings. you could argue there is greatness hiding in the details but there are hardly any details here. it is just one big fog of synths slowmotion guitars and dreary vocals. c people tell themselves that pf is somehow the greatest band in the history of popular music. if this album is part of the argument you may as well say the dire straits are the greatest apparently the majority loves soulless virtuosos. 1 star for the cover which is a classic.,0
i had always heard the middle three songs on this album and they never impressed me much. welcome to the machine is awful to listen to. wish you were here is boring depressing guitar strumming...perhaps i need to listen to the lyrics more to appreciate it but i really do not want to hear it again. have a cigar was the best of the three with it is funkiness but still i guess it was not enough to win me over. then one day like around 2014 i heard the first 5 parts of soycd on the radio. i did not even know what it was but i was intrigued by the ambient slow lead in. once those chiming guitar notes finally kicked in i realized i must be hearing floyd. the song resonated well with me so i bought it for that. i hesitate giving the album a 3 because i really do like those first 5 parts but i really really do not want to hear the rest. actually i have not given parts 6-9 their due. maybe i should try harder on those sometime. might bump it up to a 3.5?,0
regrouping after the massive success of dark side of the moon waters steered the band in the direction of a concept album about loss some of which would be explicitly about their friend and former bandmate syd barrett who eerily enough wandered into the studio during the sessions looking completely unrecognizable. i have encountered a large amount of people in my life who cite this as superior to dark side of the moon many even proclaiming it to be their favorite floyd record. for me it suffers from what i would call abbey road syndrome the production is pristine and the playing is top notch but the album fails to move or enthrall me on the whole. side one is stellar with the exquisite shine on... suite and the harrowing analog synth-fest welcome to the machine. side two becomes more ordinary for me with the funky record industry dig have a cigar sung by roy harper and the relatively mor title track probably the most mainstream song the band ever committed to tape. where is my lighter? by that point i am checked out so much that i barely notice the last four sections of shine on... which are fairly inessential. so while i appreciate the artistry of wish you were here it fails to gel for me as a whole. absolutely brilliant album cover though. owned as part of the discovery box set.,0
concept album - pretentious melancholic -  dreary serious - boring predictable atmospheric - reminds me of a storm cloud i suppose complex - it is complex trying to determine why people like this album meditative - really really boring satiric - parodying better artists and their earlier selves eclectic - literally the exact opposite of eclectic,0
gay and moody. comfortable to listen to but dull and bleak. nothing is surprising.,0
there was a distinct period in my life where at the discovery of any band or film or public figure that predated me i would talk about it to those older than me as if they know precisely who or what i am talking about then balk as soon as they inevitably reveal that hey they do not know what this little shit is prattling on about. in other words anything that influenced pop culture before 1992 was something i assumed all people who too existed before 1992 would have some memory or tied-affiliation with simply because the one thing they both share is to have been in a pre-vito genovese world. if you are still not following it is my fault i am rusty at this whole reviewing thing and to be honest i chose wish you were here as the album to warmup on because well it really is not terribly important. i will go on about that more once i drive my point home with an example at a cousins birthday dinner in what i assume was the middle of 2006 i had shine on you crazy diamond parts i-v on a cd that was blaring through my player and amidst the smell of fajitas and garlic-laden salsa i walked awkwardly over to my aunt and tried to be cool. remember this song? i said like the little shit i was. she took a headphone and put it gingerly to her ear a smile on her face as if trying to be amiable where in all honesty i would not have blamed her if she was counting the seconds til i walked away. i do not know it she said cheerily. who is it? i acted incredulous before returning to my seat. i have used wish you were here as less of an album but more of a tool to somehow tout how musically superior i was to the other eighth graders. this was of course after renouncing the likes of fall out boy and yellowcard in front of everybody but somehow plugging my ears at the objection that i still liked panic! at the disco. i would say no! i would say pink floyd is my favorite band! and i would don a black cap with the famed the dark side of the moon prism in its center. that was one of two albums that i actually truly loved by pink floyd at that point the other being the astounding and fan-affirming animals. but besides those two? pink floyd was my vessel for musical egotism and wish you were here was the ultimate i do not get it but i am going to pretend i do cd in my at-that-time eighty album library. i acted like everybody should know the full obnoxiously-tracked shine on you crazy diamond completely oblivious to the fact that i did not really care for it. i mean alright... once that signature guitar sounds off i sort of melt. but just how much bullshit surrounds that little beaut of a moment? too much i say. there is very little interesting going on in either of the bookending tunes and the meat in the middle is just a day shy of sour. okay so maybe that is not really true there are no bad tracks on wish you were here and everything here at least scores a three-star stamp but i will be damned if this record does not try my patience. take for example welcome to the machine a slab of progressive rock that has been bafflingly covered more than any other individual pink floyd track no discernible tune or point of accessibility to flock to and yet the masses laud it. i remember thinking it was wonderfully creepy at its time of personal inception but beyond that? i probably thought i loved it but it is not the next opus of beethoven. perhaps my favorite bit on the entire album is that strange drop in fidelity as have a cigar loses four-fifths of its decibels bleeding into the acoustic strum of the title track. wish you were here the song? a song i will say i admire greatly though my origins in admitting that have always felt more out of respect or like i had to like it because it was so iconic. i can say that my allegiance to it before has prospered into something true at least. i do not think it matters as to how i bend this wish you were here is an album that i am destined never to love by a band that i will always love and have come to know beyond their 1973 and 1977 output. if there was any act that i would boast to seeing live should such a thing ever become possible again pink floyd would be it and i would probably name the songs from this release most fervently when recounting the setlist to some jealous friend. nevertheless it is not lost on me. it is an album that could never ever be cooler than its sleeve but it is a fun and occasional spin.,0
more music for bank managers from everybody favourite corporate cock suckers this time with the added bonus of containing the same track twice and marginally rescued by having the jokey playful if a little ungracious have a cigar which almost amounts to a song by these guys standards although stick it on any of the truly great albums made in 74 court and spark good old boys sheet music propaganda and it would be filler at best. another insipid lazy inconsequential effort by the floyd. oh and the title track is a monumentally dull piece of songwriting.,0
lt1 bang in the middle wish you were here has what is possibly pink floyds best three song run in their entire career. not only is it a fantastic display of their prowess as composers with some of their most well structured material even if it might not feature such iconic riffs as on other releases but it also serves as a rough guide through all the strengths that they have accumulated over time with welcome to the machine showcasing their skill with dynamics have a cigar exhibiting their knack for neat grooves and wish you were here a very good example of pink floyds symbiotic relationship with their production job. in all these instances they are at the best of their game or close. i would not be surprised if the original intention here were to essentially celebrate what had become of pink floyds sound by this point so rather than pushing themselves forward they would have merely had to hone their skills a bit see what could be improved in their previous releases and make improved versions of the sound they are famous for. for instance have a cigar is almost like a corrected version of money in which they let ideas sink in rather than rushing into the solo and not letting the solo get out of hand once they reach it. overall this bout of recycling old ideas results in a very focused controlled and fluid but also exciting middle of the album. this is pink floyd at their best and a stepping stone towards the constant flow from song to song without losing momentum that they managed to get in the wall. sadly the two bookends do not share the same merits. for one thing they seemingly could not decide on a mood they begun by foreshadowing this grandiose beginning with a really extended fade in on pads and guitar but then when that is done we are sent right into a mellow jam session of sorts in which pf get the chance to drown everyone in vapid and inconsequential soloing. admittedly they do decide to stick to the mellower tone even on the second half of the suite but by that point the album should at least be hinting at its intention to end just sticking to the mellow vibes sounds really jarring at least on a first listen. for another thing the fact that it was decided to make a suite of several parts that is permeated with sprawling solos means that the progression of the song is fucked. by the time we reach the verse it is too late the momentum from the beginning is gone so it would be necessary to actually make some sort of buildup to the verse. and the verse itself although it works well without all the clutter that precedes it in the song itself it just sounds like pf are in a real hurry to get to the climax. once that is all done there is also a rather aggravating sax solo. and the song goes like this the whole time jumping from useless solo to useless solo wasting everyone is time and ruining what could have been a classic album or at least a classic ep.,0
que esperar despus de haber creado una obra definitoria?. para muchos fans wish you were here es su disco favorito de floyd y mejor que su legendario lbum previo. para muchos pero no para m. o sea de hecho que es interesante que no se hayan repetido y hayan creado un album mas centrado en atmsferas y texturas flotantes de teclado inspirado liricamente y conceptualmente por el recuerdo de syd barrett el loco diamante. pero el recordar la exuberancia de the dark side of the moon hace que en comparacin este disco me parezca muy bueno aunque menor a aquel welcome to the machine nunca me gust debo admitir. de hecho que siempre es agradable volver a oir aquella oda al fin de la inocencia que es shine on you crazy diamond y el hermoso tema que le da ttulo al album. notable.,0
this is probably one of the better pink floyd albums in that it does not have long stretches of pointless noodling and the dark musings actually have a purpose and story this time it is largely a lament for syd barrett. i do not think anything here does reach the heights of the dark side of the moon but it is more consistent as a whole and of course the album artwork is awesome. i do feel like side two is a bit more meandering than it needs to be but when does pink floyd not have some meandering stretches? a very good album and the one that made me understand their appeal entirely -- not to say that it necessarily turned me onto them.,0
this is pink floyds best album tied with the wall although i have not heard all of them so i am speaking only about the five i have heard. heard best through a giant speaker this album starts with an ambient fade-in one of musics best album opening sounds. after some slightly meanering psuedo-classical music the lyrics start at over eight minutes in. and what uplifting lyrics they are despite the knowledge that syd barret was locked up in a mental home somewhere when the album was released now dead. after some saxaphone there is a flawless cross-fade into welcome to the machine and a complete change of mood. the songs starts with the sound of an electric door and a large ceiling-fan and then the haunting guitar starts followed by david gimours scathing vocals singing of the music industry and a young teenager who thinks he is rebelling you bought a guitar to punish your ma but is actually conforming with what the music industry wants it is alright we told you what to dream. the mood of this song is quite negative but brilliant and slightly scary. side two of vynil begins with have a cigar another change in mood. it talks of the formation of the band and a music salesman talks to a young syd barret cluelessly asking which ones pink?. although the music is unremarkable it features the brilliant guest vocalist roy harper who is better than either gilmour or waters at singing and brings a slightly humrous tone to the song. after a bit of prog rock meandering not much the song is only five miniutes there is a whizz which takes us into the title track. wish you were here is one of those songs which brings a tear to the eye and is one of pink floyds most emotional songs. better than the vocals though is the lovley simple acoustic guitar more touching than any heavy metal from dream theater could ever be in it is gourgeous simplicity. it is the only time pink floyd ever embraced the principal less is more of course being progressive rockers they would not be likely to take on this principal. after some wind comes the only true disapointment of the album crazy diamond part two. the thing that made part one great was the ambient fade in the novelty and the fact it was the opening track. the mood just dosent work as a closer. of course the vocals still shine and the funerel march of part ix is good but a disapointment after four groundbreaking songs.,0
welcome to...machine.,0
overrated in extreme 75100 inmensamente sobrevalorado,0
i was pleasantly surprised when i had a re-listen to the dark side of the moon a week ago. i had some preconceptions about it but i loved it -- it had a great musical flow and balance between experimentation and pop and it is one of there rare pop albums that really has something to say about the conditio humana. so i was looking forward to this one -- which however turned out to be pretty much how i originally feared pink floyd would be. musically it is all nice and spacey and proggy and complexly layered stuff -- but what else is there to the music? when it is nice and beautiful it is tends to be overly long and boring and even lounge-y after a while they got it right on wish you were here though. when it starts getting interesting they kill the song with an extremely annoying 70s synth solo welcome to the machine which they never did on dsotm. if only the lyrics would have been half as great as on dark side! here you get two esoteric rants about the music industry and the rest is supposed to be about the band missing syd barrett so much. they did that one on dark side too eclipse and it feels more genuine there than filling three quarters of an album with that stuff here. especially considering that to my knowledge nobody of the band even went to visit him since he had left. i know i am a little harsh here. it is not a bad album per se and there is some good stuff to be found here. but i just cannot understand why this album has the same standing as dark side of the moon. the most interesting thing about this album is the great cover which i never realized actually is a real photograph -- and reading up on this weird story when barrett suddenly turned up in the studio during the final recording of shine on you crazy diamond with nobody recognizing him at first source in 1975 a strange reunion took place at emi studios attributable jerry shirley feels to syds uncanny sixth sense of timing. the last time i saw him was possibly the last time the guys in the floyd saw him too. they were putting the finishing touches on wish you were here. earlier that day dave gilmour had gotten married and they had to work that night so emi had this roundtable dinner in the canteen for them. across the table from me was this overweight hare krishna-looking chap. i thought maybe it was just someone who somebody knows. i looked at dave and he smiled then i realized it was syd. the guy had to weigh close to 200 pounds and had no hair on his head. it was a bit of a shock but after a minute i plucked up enough courage to say hello. i introduced my wife and i do not know i think he just laughed. i asked him what he was doing lately. oh you know not much eating sleeping. i get up eat go for a walk sleep. that night the band finished the album and were playing back the final mix of shine on you crazy diamond. when the song ended roger waters turned to syd and said well syd what do you think of that ? he said sounds a bit old. i am all with syd on that one.,0
general golden age pink floyd bullshit. great instrumentation great song structures great solos great song writing. everything a pink floyd album needs. but it sort of falls to the wayside when you have these things and staying power like animals and the wall. this is a great album not an amazing album.,0
i do not get why this is such a great album -,0
a bizarre collection of aimless jams interspersed with revelational moments of beauty on occasion.,0

much ado for.....would not say nothing but in my opinion comes at a time of lack of ideas and is a bit confused....understandable after the dark side,0
wish you were here is pink floyds best album without question. as a song cycle it is their most cohesive collection of tracks. in addition they perfectly fuse their propensity for psychedelic andor progressive-rock ambiance shine on you crazy diamond with strong pop hooks have a cigar and wish you were here. while it is probably easier to read this albums lyrics as once again a cautionary tale about their fallen ex-leader syd barrett a theme also present on dark side of the moon and the wall it is more instructive to think of roger waters lyrics as examining the trappings of fame both positive and negative. once again richard wright is the secret weapon creating the shimmering atmosphere atop which david gilmours masterful leads float. with the cliched welcome to the machine as the only misstep wish you were here remains both the most consistent and best-executed of pink floyds long-players.,0
this album is generally moodier and more multifaceted than anything else in pink floyds catalog. wish you were here is experimental without taxing its listener with dives into lazy prog which for floyd usually means some odd audio clips played through spacey sounding guitars. i am really talking about dark side... here. anywho the title track is the highlight of the album but the whole thing feels very emotional and occasionally moving.,0
wish this was piper at the gates of dawn.,0
i listened to this to death when i was in my early teen years. so much so that i never thought i would ever want to hear it again but lately i have been getting into jazz music which has re-awakened my love for music in general. so while i am feeling like this i decided to listen to some old favorites to see if they held up over time or not. this album holds up now i do not think it is great or anything but i enjoyed the album. i think there is too much noodling around on the synthesizers but that is mainly just on shine on you crazy diamond 1-5. have a cigar and welcome to the machine both sound good after all these years. which brings us to the title track wish you were here. this is one of pink floyds best songs and it really sounds great after not hearing it for twenty-odd years. i have played it a few times and i cannot get over how great it sounds. alas it was the only song that struck me like that but i definitely think that this is a very good album and i would recommend it to all music lovers. everywhere. check it out.,0
i have these great memories of riding along in my friend graysons moms station wagon. we had great tapes! we had pavement and the beach boys and cat stevens ... we would drive around looking for trouble and cheap food... guided by voices and the pixies beat happening and ... what is this... can you change this? okay i will give it some more time... hey can i pick the next tape? reminds me of having to pay for the pizza every time.,0
this is my second attempt at writing a scathing review of this hugely overrated bloated monster. the first one mysteriously disappeared but i will be heard! the only thing i can remember about my previous review was it began like this look ma the emperors got no clothes! i am calling this album out it is useless. fifth best album of all time my rosy behind! it is a sad tedious bitter trudge through a slowed down cod-blues. i like the floyd check my other reviews but this one seems to me to carry the scars of trying to follow up dark side of the moon. they do not know what they want to do. shine on you crazy diamond is about syd of course and the lyrics are quite touching but musically it is a slow dawdle through a bunch of solos. have a cigar is waters first i-hate-the-music-biz song unless that is actually welcome to the machine and wish you were here contains the earliest reference i am aware of to the war which ultimately takes us to the final cut an album which is worse than this one but not as boring. shine on parts 6-9 actually sound better at 45 and they are over quicker. i honestly cannot see what people like about this record.,0
a pretty solid album but not on par with the dark side of the moon and meddle this probably contains the most classic rock favorites along with the wall. welcome to the machine have a cigar wish you were here are all played on the radio quite a bit. not my favorite floyd album and the synthesizers do get a bit annoying at times.,0
si trova qui la sintesi di tutto ci che non mi piace dei pink floyd brani allungati a dismisura che meriterebbero massimo 5 minuti canto lagnosissimo canzoni sinceramente ruffiane ed unatmosfera di fondo al confine tra tanti generi ma che non ne richiama nessuno. e di sicuro un capolavoro di stile e tecnica e produzione ma nella lunga suite che copre pi di met album non trovo molto di pi degli elementi che ho descritto sopra n nessuno spunto davvero degno di interesse. welcome to the machine il brano pi interessante apre una tematica che verr poi sviluppata nel successivo animals. la title track ovviamente  un brano pallido ed inconsistente. e un album francamente noioso perch rarefatto che la classe dei musicisti non riesce appieno a salvare.,0
it must be good because i am so sick of it i never want to hear it again. they were never as good without syd.,0
2.6 believe me it pains me that one of the most over rated albums of all time was made by my favorite band. i do not even want to ask people what their favorite pink floyd album is anymore for fear that this album is their answer. from the craziness of atom heart mother ummagumma and meddle. to the more refined sound of dsotm and animals thre are so many great pink floyd albums out there. yet this is the one that everybody likes. it is comparable to the division bell it is so watered-down and un-floydian.,0
at least it is a little bit better than dark side of the moon. mostly due to wish you were here the song if they had done more of such songs i would probably like them more.,0
tecnicamente brillante ma emotivamente freddo.,0
proof that the fanatic is the worst source of information possible. bands whose music is quietly and infrequently admitted to be good music are usually good bands and have made good music. bands with thousands of fanatics are just that - fanatic breeders. they are like opium whose popularity obliterates all order and thinking and submits one to being a fan. that is how pink floyd works. this is okay music but with very few intelligent ideas to offer. it is almost like a collage for the ability of some skilled musicians to play well in unison. it gives prog-rock a bad name.,0
worth owning for the title track and shine on you pt1-5. the rest is pretty standard prog fare lightened as was to become more and more the case by gilmours melodic guitar touches and some nice keys by wright. frankly i could live quite happily if i never heard welcome... and have a ever again.,0
i like this wish you were here more than dark side of the moon but only by about half a quark so i will give them the same score. it is basically easy listening with a bit of a bite and some pretty alright lyrics.,0
some good stuff but a comedown from the dark side of the moon.,0
all there tribute to syd barrett shine on you crazy diamond these days remains one and only my favourite song by pink floyd remember when you were young you shone like the sun. now there is a look in your eyes like black holes in the sky title song wish you were here i like pretty much too so you think you can tell heaven from hell blue skies from pain... though now these words do not seem to me as clever as they used to now they look no more than a trite truism. welcome to the machine and have a cigar sound to me now like a dump of outworn noises and the album in its entirety is a bit tedious.,0
so according to rym this is one of the best pink floyd albums and even more one of the best records of all time. well well well. starting a review like this usually means the writers going to crush the album for the rest of the review. well that is partially true. but only partially. i understand the whole emotion surrounding this album  the title alone is quite self-explanatory. wish you were here. you would expect sadness and nostalgia as the records main themes and minor chords all around. call me insensitive but while i absolutely feel all this on the two best tracks shine on you crazy diamond pts. 1-5 and wish you were here i think that in the other tracks they were just trying too hard and never really manage to reach that. what do you have then ? standard progressive rock that is for sure with end-of-the-world epic atmosphere loads of cheesy sounds from outer space i mean 70s outer space and pretty lame vocals too what happened here ?. not exactly my favorite music recipe. have a cigar then ? no thanks.,0
the only real genius i have ever found to pink floyd was their ability to so-perfectly synch the dark side of the moon up with the wizard of oz. it is really a shame they did not sequence wish you were here to work as a soundtrack for gone with the wind or some such something. would have been another feather in their collective cap as far as i am concerned. that said i can listen to this album in its entirety something i cannot dream of doing with the snooze-inducing wall. david gilmour - vocals guitar nick mason - drums richard wright - keyboards vocals roger waters - vocals bass guitar produced by pink floyd 1975 columbia records jc 33453 highs - it is not the wall lows - it is not the wizard of oz like this go for you would be much better off with porcupine tree than anything else from this bunch acquired some time at some place originally reviewed 07 august 2005 2486988 oongawad 03 december 2007 12536176,0

wish you were here a concept album released in 1975 explores the ideas of absence the music business and the rise and fall of original pink floyd member syd barrett. the conceptual angle was composed by roger waters so its aspects especially those involving barrett are of a deeply personal nature. unlike it is predecessor dark side of the moon wish you were here handles its critiques in a straight-forward manner. while dark side of the moon employs a more subtle over-arching approach time explores the modern perception of reality money deals with materialism for example wywh and its follow-up 1977s animals are more specific the latter even references an actual person hey you whitehouse. ha ha charade you are referring to morality crusader mary whitehouse. that being said the focus of wish you were here is primarily on the business side of the music industry and its negative effects with barrett serving as a lens into the concept. the extended and separated multi-movement piece shine on you crazy diamond is directly related to sid while welcome to the machine and have a cigar focus on the industry. the title track sees waters exploring his personal feelings regarding syd and also it appears to me his feelings toward the music business. shine on you crazy diamond i-v opens with an elegiac air as horn-like keys move throughout the constant pulse of wrights synthesizer serving as a fitting introduction to the extended piece about barrett. it is joined by gilmours shimmering almost too bluesy tone which rounds out the intro. at the 400 mark gilmours spaced-out meant physically and descriptively 4-note lick sets a haunting quality before the song launches into full-floydian force as the rest of the group joins. i love the guitar tone but gilmours playing always leaves me wanting more for every cosmic lick there is 2 out-and-out blues licks. it is as if the bluesy nature of his playing makes it sound too generic or grounded. not that his playing is generic but that blues-influenced players are more than a dime a dozen it takes away from the otherworldliness. always adding to the otherworldliness though are waterss ghostly vocals. they are slightly mad which is especially fitting as he sings of syd remember when you were young you shone like the sun. shine on you crazy diamond. now there is a look in your eyes like black holes in the sky. shine on you crazy diamond.  a now the saxophone. it is not so bad i guess the counter play with the guitar helps but i can do without it. it has nothing to do with this song in particular but it is a personal quirk of mine i just do not particularly like the sound of the saxophone in rock-oriented music and never have. in this case it is like it takes me from an outer space psych ward into a new orleans speakeasy which i guess is not such trip up for some people. welcome to the machine takes the story away from sid though he is still a part of it and brings the focus onto the greediness of the music industry. the song opens with the pulsing of machines. it is static save for intermittent buzzing and remains totally inorganic throughout--the exception being the well-placed sweetly human strums of the acoustic guitar. even gilmours vocals have a robotic orwellian quality to them as he belts out welcome my son welcome to the machine. what did you dream? it is alright we told you what to dream. you dreamed of a big star he played a mean guitar he always ate in the steak bar. he loved to drive in his jaguar. so welcome to the machine.  these lyrics are especially important because they refer to the manufacturing of the rock star image by record companies and the fabrication of rebellion glamour and whatever else comes along with stardom or listening to such and such music. waterss simple yet alien bass keeps the listener on edge unable to relax or to be soothed by the guitar and string patches. this is especially true in the welcome to the machine refrain. the song does not do much overall which fits with it is mechanized nature but clocking in at 7 minutes it can get boring depending on my mood. welcome to the machine ends with a closing door and what sounds like and unlike a car speeding. this is followed by the sounds of a party signifying fakephony people which fades out thus ending side 1. the second side opens with have a cigar the ever-present pink floyd rocker that seems to find its way at least once on every record since meddle. in this case it almost serves as this albums answer to money. this tune featuring guest vocals from roy harper points to the phoniness of industry players and of people in general as these lyrics exhibit well i have always had a deep respect and i mean that most sincerely. the band is just fantastic that is really what i think. oh by the way which ones pink? and did we tell you the name of the game boy we call it riding the gravy train.  despite it is money-like bluesboogie elements i find this song to fit better than the aforementioned does on dark side of the moon. like money the bluesy swagger of have a cigar is used to enhance the concept. i understand the role of money but damn i do not like that song. i do not necessarily like this track either but i do not dislike it i appreciate it is role as a part of the whole. the raunchy decadence of have a cigar its personal nature and wrights thick layers of keyboards probably make it less distracting. it is also a lot more scathing lyrically and musically while i find money to be too happy-go-lucky. the song ends as gilmours solo cuts out to a distant radio sound as it flows into the title track. wish you were here begins with the changing of the dial in a car radio before the song itself begins still in the distance. the loudly plucked acoustic lead jars this subdued atmosphere and i would have to say that is the songs most interesting part. it is a relatively straight-forward composition overall in which nothing really of interest happens until the blowing wind at the end. this strengthens the theme of abandonment and leads into the final segments of shine on you crazy diamond. part vi adds to the wind and ominous feel to the abandonment like fast approaching black clouds on an otherwise empty desert horizon. the bass line is similar to that of welcome to the machine in execution and atmosphere and gilmours jagged guitar stabs like a knife. as the song progresses the keys and gilmours rapid staccato picking work in the higher registers giving it a sense of frantic urgency. near the end wright plays the clavinet which gives it an awkward funky feel that is not entire out of place yet that does not entirely fit either. it is almost bizarre enough to seem right. the final minutes recall the elegiac opening but in a more celebratory fashion before fading meditatively to a close. as with all far-reaching concept albums all elements of the album contribute to the themes. music and lyrics should be obvious but an often overlooked aspect is that of the album art. the sticker on the album sleeve features two mechanical hands locked in a formal handshake. the robotic nature of the art points to the gesture as a routine and for that reason usually empty. similarly the cover itself examines the handshake. this time we have two businessmen shaking hands with one of them on fire read getting burned. the back cover extends the commentary on the impersonal greedy nature of business as a faceless empty-suit no wrists and ankles floyd salesman peddles his wares in the desert the ultimate irony being that the group themselves are a part of the machine. but let this reflective bit of music show that riding the gravy train is not all it is cracked up to be. as many who come into fame success or money find out paper is not the answer and it leaves people burnt out andor spiritually malnourished.,0
this album was all a bit too spacey and experimental for me. do not get me wrong i love experimental rock in all it is weird and wonderful forms its just that this album is extremely inconsistent apart from the absolutely outstanding wish you were here which is one of the best songs ever.,0
an overrated album not by far their best like is praised all the time . is so much great music to descover from the 70s that is hard for me to listen more than twice a year this album. is not a bad album that is no doubt but to me is almost boring. shine one crazy diamond part i is stunning very smooth and is clear that the members are very talented but have a cigar is a mediocre piece the other tracks are so so. this album has an istorical importance to many  no doubt pink floyd is one of the major influence in music but to me is an overrated band that does not mean i under appreciate thier talent and creativity throgh the years. so a 3 star album for me the next one animals is much better and is my favourite floyd album,0
sigue sonando muy bien quizs mejor de lo que en realidad es. suficiente para poder disfrutar de l porque esa ha sido siempre la ventaja de pink floyd ms all de sus ambiciones sus discos son siempre inmediatamente disfrutables y fciles de asimilar. el disco cae en clichs de todo tipo pero no tiene desperdicio shine on you crazy diamond es el mejor ejemplo pieza de 25 minutos que mezcla guitarras blues con pasajes csmicos y una cancin medio gospel sin ninguna explicacin. absurdo pero siempre entretenido y bien tocado. welcome to the machine parte de un tpico trillado pero lo conduce con un dramatismo vvido y creble. wish you were here es una balada que representa a la vez la falta de principios del grupo y su alta calidad compositiva. slamente fracasa have a cigar el equivalente inspido de money.,0
nada imposible que no le veo la puta gracia a pink floyd por ninguna parte.,0
shine on you is not a bad tune but soooo repetitive and morose. radically over rated 8th best album of all time? no way jose!,0
so i have heard this is one album any fan of pink floyd needs to listen too? well i am a half and half fan i like the progressive rock era meddle etc. but i dislike parts of their back catalogue. oh well the proof is in the pudding as it were i best have a listen before i judge it. the album starts of with the song shine on you crazy diamond pts. 1-5 which i have heard is most famous pink floyd songs among with many others of course. the song itself is starts of with an almost atmospheric introduction before moving onto a bluesy solo. to be fair the whole song is bordering on progressive rock featuring blues mind you i do not really care it sounds great. the album then progresses onto welcome to the machine which is probably my least favourite on the album it is alright but as i see it it is a filler track. but with that it does contain some eerie synths on it maybe to play homage to the psychedelic era of floyds history? next is the song have a cigar is in pretty much the same vein as the rest of the album bluesy rock. after that it comes to one of the most famous pink floyd songs wish you were here. maybe it is just me but i like it but i do not think it defines the band as much as other songs. it is a ballad-sque song with soft humble notes threw out. well worth listening too but like i said i do not care for it much. the album closes on the rest of the parts to the song shine on you crazy diamond. a great closing song to a great album. on a whole the album contains some of pink floyds most memorable tracks and probably to many fans their favourite. in summary i thought i would dislike this album but on the positive side i do actually like it. the album features some classic pink floyd album. it shows more depth to pink floyd good song writing various different playing techniques. recommended.,0
oh gawd look what is landed on my lap as part of the go review that album game. well the easy bit ... how i came to own wish you were here ... it is my boyfriends so when i moved in and our collections merged the number of pf albums i owned doubled. i think i can also say with confidence that he has not listened to it once in the 27 months that i have been living here. i am really not a fan. when i was at school quite a few of the boys owned all the 70s pf albums and most of them who did were the ones with the biggest loudest hi-fi systems. i was at a boarding school and the walls were thin so you could guarantee to hear pf every single day. if you were really unlucky and your room was next door to a noisy masturbater you would get to hear that every day too. i had a cassette player with an ear-piece instead of headphones and was mainly listening to fleetwood mac bob dylan and lou reed and to be perfectly honest found pf really rather boring. my lack of pf albums had caught the attention of almost everyone who had ever perused my music collection. i would also had a previous and mercifully short-lived relationship with someone who pf were their favourite band and my lack of their stuff was viewed with a certain amount of snobby disdain. in order to prove that i was in fact open minded and willing to give anything a go i bought the latest pf album on the market - the division bell. funny thing was even this ardent they can do no wrong and are the best band in the universe fan soon to be ex-boyfriend of mine reluctantly admitted that this particular album was not quite on a par with their earlier stuff. i thought it had one good song on and the rest was cack. this is roughly what i think about wywh only i would add an extra word to the description ... i think it has one good song on it and the rest is proggy cack. the firstlast song just goes on and on forever the next two are unbelievably average and instantly forgettable 70s numbers and the title track has been so etched onto my brain over the past 35 years giving me no chance to dislike it because if i did i would have to go and live on the dark side of the moon ha bloody ha in order to not have to hear it ever again. so on the plus side? it has some groovy artwork. it is kind of hard to dis one of the most popular albums ever but i have done it before do people really honestly truely think forever changes is that good? give me a break it is a complete load of shit! and if asked i will probably do it again. a generous 1.,0
looking for your next investigation into boring uneventful music that you are supposed to love? if you have not heard this yet you are missing out! yadda yadda wish you were here is great yadda yadda blah welcome to the machine is pretty cool yep yep yadda oky doke. enjoy.,0
the eponymous track is one of my favourite songs from the band but i cannot really see what else can be loved on this album so much. there is hardly anything but endless epic synth solos sometimes supported by guitar virtuosity and as i am listening they just do not really go anywhere they do not have any intentions. maybe if i considered this as an ambient record it would make sense but it simply does not have the spirit for that either.,0
same problem as the dark side of the moon only more so. a it is rather slow and boring sometimes b i do not have the patience to appreciate its true brilliance. you choose which.,0
prog rock is in fashion now. how else could it be that an album that only consists of five songs most of them heavily overlengthy is currently rated 4.28 by 36841 people on rym edit updated 12 october 2019? the number would make sense if sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band was rated by even more numerous thousands of rymers but as we know it is not. and what about the average rating? do you really think it is absolutely that good? i consider it more like fashion  or a scientific paradigm as long as it is valid or reliable to hold wish you were here in a high position thousands of people do so. 1973 was to prog what 1967 was to psych. beside the dark side of the moon by pink floyd tubular bells by mike oldfield became a worldwide smash and as i have noted elsewhere that was when progressive  as a musical attribute  lost its connection to the socio-spiritual progress. a couple of years later pink floyd released wish you were here including almost 26 minutes divided into two tracks of a giant epic called shine on you crazy diamond. listening to the first part it takes over four minutes before the drums appear and again more than four minutes before vocals appear. i claim this was floyds own tubular bells. and of course this means  i am sorry mike o you did better with your pop songs!  that the 1975 incarnation of pink floyd had lost some of the progress within. this was not their first time ummagumma and atom heart mother in particular were slightly regressive rock records. lyrically crazy diamond is positive about the mental adventures of syd barrett but at the same time it seals the fact that after syds departure in the circle of pink floyd those adventures were going to be over. musically i think the latter part of crazy diamond may be even better than the former. none of it is bad anyway. welcome to the machine is overlengthy and actually a bit useless. then comes have a cigar possibly a link between time and the more rhythmic fragments on the wall. a nice track. the title song is a worthwhile classic of course. but that is all. except a few interesting pieces of cover art. so wish you were here is not a bad album. unlike the first two velvet underground albums it is real music. one two or even four of the five songs could be part of an excellent package like the dark side of the moon but hopefully not in a pompously overlengthy form. none of the tracks is plain bad in fact the album is quite good of course but come on is this really modern music at its most essential?,0
the two part title song is so relaxed that i feel as if i have to lay down to listen to it. makes me wonder what kind of drugs they were taking when they made this that caused them to be this relaxed. acid? prozac? wish you were here is a great song. this one sounds as if they taped two different concept albums to one and other. one about syd barrett and a second one about how they hate the recording industry. despite the fact that they joined it voluntarily became rich because of it and could have probably left it if they really wanted to. roger waters always loved complaining. the second album has have a cigar and welcome to the machine on it. is nice but just not as good as the first one. r,0
neck-and-neck with animals for the title of best floyd album post-barrett. make what you will of that as it is coming from someone who normally cannot stand waters-fronted pink floyd. have a cigar is fantastic. the same cannot by any means be said of the title track. i also dig the first five parts of shine on rule of thumb boys when you have already made a song with five parts that is plenty. stop there.,0
not nearly as good as dark side of the moon. shine on meanders on and on and on...on both sides of the record. sandwiched in between the middle tracks are all excellent.,0
uno tra i pi ispirati e godibili album dei pink floyd.,0
i heard a few and this master sound gold sbm cd release of wish you were here sounds best .,0
this is the best floyd album i have heard and it still is very very weak. i am not a fan.,0
as i make my way through the great classics list. i come to pink floyds. wish you were here. i was slightly underwhelmed. respectfully i do appreciate what they were doing for the time. and hear the influences over many of the acts i love today. but really i did not see the reason for waiting so long to get to the beautiful part of shine on you crazy diamond. actually the end half i enjoyed more. welcome to the machine is indeed innovative but not all that pleasant to listen to. have a cigar is good and of course wish you were here is so classic and has such great lyrics what is not to like. by the way which ones pink?,0
best pink floyd album!? come on! while i would never expect any pink floyd albums to sound energetic except the one when they had that syd cat wish you were here is just a lazy effort. shine on you crazy diamond part 1-5 is pretty but it becomes quite tiresome after a couple of listens because the first half sounds so uninspired yes i mean gilmours solo. shine on you crazy diamond parts 6-9 is much more interesting than the first part because of all the crazy styles they try cram into the twelve minutes however it is still aimless. wish you were here is a unique country ballad for the floyd but unfortunately pink floyd cannot really compose a great country ballad. i have heard much better. wind sounds so lame on a record. so three songs are dedicated to good old syd rip but my final verdict on these three songs if you have not figured out by now they are kind of a snooze fest. my favorite song is have a cigar. silly lyrics and groovy composition with a nice use of the synthesizer this song is fun fun fun! i actually like roy harpers voice in this song as well as what i consider some of gilmours best guitar work on the album too bad one of his solos is interrupted by a strange radio fade-out or something. and too bad the lyrics of the song only retread the music industry sucks lyrics of the previous and inferior song welcome to the machine. it is an amusing song with a cute gimmick but like most of the songs on this record it gets old after after a while. did we really need two songs about the music industry? this review probably makes the album sound worse than what it really is. i really really like have a cigar and most of the other songs have their gorgeous moments the acoustic portion in the middle of the machinery sounds in welcome to the machine. there is just too much boring fluff in between. smoke a bowl and you can add one star to this review.,0
after the sprawling epic concept album the dark side of the moon pink floyd released the more accessible wish you were here which was an affectionate biograph of ex-member syd barrett. whatever you might think about floyd - pompous over-indulgent pretentious complex all of which can be levelled to some degree at this album - there is no denying their talent as musicians. so whilst you may become frustrated at the prolonged length of the songs that ability is capable of making you sit up and take notice at any time. there are only four songs included - the massive shine on you crazy diamond bookending the album - but in truth that is more than enough. gilmour has never played guitar better and waters lyrical and musical restraint makes a welcome change. crazy diamond when it kicks in reminiscent of the alien welcome in close encounters is a genuine rock classic welcome to the machine with its fuzzy electronic keyboards is boring have a cigar is an amusing take on the music business and wish you were here is a touching tribute to barrett. there is no doubt that this is an accomplished album which won the group a great deal of plaudits but for me there is something missing - maybe it is soul.,0
good but overrated.,0
wish you were here went from the bottom of my pink floyd pile to the very top. it is the only recording i have by them i deep good enough to listen to a lot. shine on you crazy diamond has everything going for it and i was listening to it in a very atmospheric mood and i was blown away. a great album that does not lose momentum and is bolstered by the fact that it is 5 songs long. if shine on you crazy diamond was turned into one song at the end like was originally planned this album would be demoted. it works as a bookend to the album and fits nicely unlike echos which while being artistically a great pink floyd achievement i found myself already drained by the time it came on. i never get the feeling that i could be listening to something with more instant gratification when i listen to this album. it is great and should stand out over time as their greatest achievement. syd would be proud.,0
one reason i do not like floyd is because they took away fantasy from prog rock and choose to follow instead a dull  boring and pop-ish style that made them superstars.albums like this and dark side are good because they managed to write good songsbut most of their catalogue is wellboring. i really love prog rock but i never really liked floyd.this album makes the exception because it is actually very emotional.,0
i like shine on you crazy diamond wish you were here is a good fm standard welcome to the machine is not that bad and have a cigar does not really suck. but i will never consider this as their greatest album nor as a great album nor as a very good one. in my opinion this is one of the most overrated albums in the history of music. i have tried a lot of times but i do not get the great thing here.,0
wish you were here and that one guitar line in shine on you crazy diamond are pretty great but...i mean....come on!,0
let us have this thing where one guy... this one businessman is shaking another businessmans hand but then the other businessman is engulfed in flame,0
shine on you crazy diamond and have a cigar are good but the former has little business lasting over 25 minutes. welcome to the machine is outright boring. wish you were here of course is one of the best songs ever.,0
middle three tracks are all great but the bookending jams are all that was wrong with pink floyd at the time. i must say that have a cigar is my single favorite floyd song from the post-syd era.,0
shine on you crazy diamond and wish you were here are excellent. total masterpieces. the other two are ok but i find myself skipping past them every time i listen to this album.,0
not as engaging as dark side of the moon and a bit less proggy. still quite solid and entertaining in doses. again certain radio stations have pf hours so even shine on you crazy diamond gets air time preventing the need to take up precious storage.,0
as the 70s went on pink floyd seemed to lose that edge this is a classic album with the title track obviously about the founder sid barrett.,0
the title tracks are the end result of the process begun on atom heart mother and what a sorry progression it is. also there is a sort of hollogrammy j-m jarre feel to them much of the time this is nothing particularly new see the first track of meddle but at least it has a few balls there. the terrible thing about it is that in some way it sort of does work.,0
i do not get why this album gets such good ratings generally. the first and last songs although they have some really good parts go on waaaaaaay too long. the second song sucks. the synths on it are down right embarrassing on that song not that it was really salvagable and they even threaten to ruin the title track. the third song does not suck but it is pretty boring. the title track on the other hand is pretty great. but really this has to be one of the most over-rated albums i have ever heard. just woefully dated and self-indulgent as hell.,0
have a cigar - a very good song i like it its ni...ce. welcome to the machine - never had a whole lot of use for this song it sounds like something that was made for a short animated film of demented robots from a different world not much here musically in my opinion. wish you were here - a great song classic one of my favorite floyd songs. i will continue to listen to it much. the next long window blog will explain the 3.5 rating which i believe this album deserves since i prefer - the wall animals and dsotm too this album. which by the looks of things makes me the minority on this site. shine on you crazy diamond parts 1 - 1000000 i think parts of this song are great first 4 minutes - needless setup next 2 minutes - kind of boring end of 7th minute - great guitar solo end of 8th minute - vocals hooray!! 11th minute - very cool sax solo 14-19th minute - getting very dramatic i guess this is were the acid would start to kick in had i taken some at the start of the song. 20-22nd minute - physcadelic music kicks in. again not on drugs so not doing much for me. 22-25th minute - ok the word dragging is really starting to apply. 26th minute - hey wait i think the song is ending wow! i made it all the way through without the aid of acid. with that being said i do not see this song ever making any mix cd playlists or me just putting it on i guess the whole 26 minute thing is just a little bit too much for me. that is why i give it a 3.5,0
i really like the core of the songs on this album but sometimes it seems to go off on what i can best describe as a musical tangent. but then again i am not on drugs. perhaps that would change my opinion...,0
great album,0
i blame this on classic rock radio. i spent my formative years listening to classic rock radio until i finally just got fed up with it. here is a radio format that covers about 20 years roughly 1965-1985 with a focus on the 70s at least when i was listening and has a playlist of approximately 12 songs. classic rock is about as close as our current corporate run radio empires have to the free-form aor formats that i have only heard legends of. classic rock radio is not tied to singles or current chart positions and could play whatever they like really. but they continue to play the same songs from pink floyd led zeppelin tom petty acdc and queen. why not add more artists to that playlist? why not even add more songs from the handful of artists they do play? why such a limited playlist? i know that as much as people like me bitch about the limited playlists the more the corporate machine tells us it is because that is really just the way we like it. welcome to the machine. this album contains four of the approximately 12 songs that classic rock radio stations play. i heard this album too many times even before i ever tried to listen to the full album. i am older wiser and about 15 years away from my classic rock radio days now. i think i am finally getting to the point where i can hear wish you were here without thinking not again! i like this album it is good but it is not the pink floyd album that i am going to reach for those would be dark side or animals. maybe in another five years or so i will come to love it. but being able to finally like it is a good start.,0
at the time this was released i thought it was a bit of a letdown after dsotm. i like the album all the songs are good and it is interesting production. it is just not hugely dynamic. it makes good music in the car on a long trip. on the other hand after all the years i have had a copy of it i still find myself listening to it.,0
the title track is as terrific a song as they come and the rest of it shares the same spacy yet not totally indulgent sound of its predecessor,0
while the title track is my original favorite floyd song and certainly my favorite gilmour floyd song the album itself lacks a certain energy to sustain it all the way through. this can be attributed to the fact that 23 of the album are taken up by the two movements of shine on you crazy diamond. it is not a bad epic at all and it probably is a pretty good tribute to the erratic late syd barrett. it moves in fits and starts accelerates and then languishes. i could have done with just the first part myself. i saw a documentary of the album where the members said the album was supposed to be in part a tribute to syd. when they showed up at the studio one day to record they encountered a guy with his head completely shaven eyebrows and all jumping up and down brushing his teeth! according to rick wright they asked someone who that was and were told it was syd barrett. that was met with melancholy by the members each of whom cherish barretts contribution and impact on the band. how this affected the album cannot be known. the shine on tribute moves awkwardly into the somewhat upbeat anti-industry tracks welcome to machine and have a cigar sung by roy harper. from there it shifts again to the very warm and personal feel of wish you were before finishing out with the last remnants of shine on. they are all good songs in and of themselves but it just does not all meld together the way dark side or animals does. it does however have one of the greatest album covers of all-time. on a personal note in my midwestern atypical fraternity house in the late 80s and early 90s oddly about 4 of the 12 residents owned this album. of course in this environment things get lost misplaced stolen etc. at one point we were all inexplicably missing this disc! thankfully i found mine.,0
sandwhiched between dsotm and animals wywh although sonically gorgeous pales in comparison to both. i always wondered why roy harper sang have a cigar it sounds like something waters should have done strange.,0
what the hell did i use to hear in this album that made me give it 4.5 stars as a teenager? relistening to this for the first time in 6 years or so i just think this is one of the dullest albums that i have ever heard save the title track. each song is at least twice as long as it should be again save the title track. going through my old ratings has been pretty eye-opening so far for me both in terms of what i continue to consider great music and what i no longer think is notable. pink floyd has taken a notable hit in my eyes. half the band my 16 year old self thought they were. i used to think this was a 4.5 star album!,0
pink floyd is about dark side of the moon. and animals. and then i suppose about atom heart mother. and then maybe just maybe about wish you were here.,0
i remember liking it. but i bought it and played it again a couple of times and it is just so ponderous.,0
it is not a bad album however i like dark side of the moon better because i think it manages to be experimental without being drawn out... as wish you were here can get.,0
wish you were here cemented pink floyds stature as stars of the mainstream singing for the people despite not being part of the people anymore. it is centerpiece was shine on you crazy diamond which signaled the return of the progressive rock epic divided in ten parts and split in two sides. getting underway with parts 1-5 the intro bridged their former space-rock with their current soft-jazz-rock via the form of the lush soundscape. this was not music to freak out it was music to relax. it continued with a typical jam all in all a more convincing effort than the previous the dark side of the moon where the progressive element was limited to it being a concept album. the main waters-ian verse one the psychodramas which made his name was presented in a blues-gospel guise. truth be told this was a new form of easy listening one with an intellectual and existential pretense. softness could now be justified. parts 6-9 were practically cut from the same cloth just following a reverse structure whereas a more energetic jam led to a reprise of the main verse which in turn led to a wright-ian soft-jazz funk exercise before it concluded with a more lugubrious theme that eventually scattered in cosmic dust. essentially even though this was a classy composition it was little more than echoes and atom heart mother revisited and rearranged for mass consumption. it also shows just how much they have slumped from the glory days of interstellar overdrive and a saucerful of secrets. if the former was a schizophrenic acid casualty and the second an avant-rock watershed that bordered on cosmic enlightenment then shine on you crazy diamond limped along in the brave-new-world made out of upper-class cocktail parties depressant drugs and intellectual pretensions. the real highlight was welcome to the machine set on the rhythm of an industrial pump and featuring synthetic harmonies and mild mechanical dissonance thus giving musical credence to the drama-rock of roger waters who apparently felt alienated by the corporate record-industry that had made him rich in the first place. the other two tracks were have a cigar which was an ok blues-funk melodic-rock exercise and wish you were here which was a lame ballad.,0
the song wish you were here is amazing. there is a real soul bearing on this song. however the rest is a great big nag of shite. not a good bag either. like a steaming tramp shite. i have a cigar is so bad and shine on... is terrible. more melodious melodies have emitted from the back passage of a chimp. get out now.,0
shine on you crazy diamond  wow...,0
...and here we have the floyd post-commercial breakthrough attempting to follow up the audio masterpiece that got them there. it was not easy obviously and the band nearly split over the course of the sessions. and the results? 4 new songs spread out over 2 long lp sides. this is where synthesisers and saxophones go when they are feeling sick i mean slick. shine on you crazy diamond is a likable tribute to syd barrett though by lps end it has long outstayed its welcome and makes you wonder if something could have been done differently to prevent listening fatigue. the four note guitar riff that gilmour introduces the band with early on is absolutely brilliant hands down my favorite moment on the whole record. wish you were here is the other good song another barrett tribute. this song can be rather moving but i have heard it so many times in many different often utterly despicable reinterpretations that i have no real opinion of it anymore. please leave this song and across the universe alone those of you looking to cover an old not so well known tune. that leaves welcome to the machine and have a cigar the weaker cuts. the former reeks of then-state of the art tomfoolery mainly from rick wright mixing synths with gilmours acoustic guitar and dramatic vocalising. this song is about as useless as the floyd would get during their big decade the 70s. the only way to possibly tolerate it is by putting it in the background. have a cigar with lead vocals by pf pal roy harper is a little better but does not do much in making wish you were here a substantial album. it seems like their trying to have fun but there is no physical way that that can be accomplished in the constraints of 1975 pink floyd. listening to wish you were here i get the image of nick mason dressed leisurely hopping into a fast sporty car with drivers gloves on and throwing a cassette in the state-of-the-art stereo the car has and blasting the contents loudly. it is a yawn but wish you were here could indeed be a lot worse like say if they recorded a whole album using only homemade objects rather than instruments.,0
wish you were here fue uno de mis discos de cabecera cuando era adolescente pero ahora tengo la sensacin de haberlo dejado ya atrs. no cabe duda de que eran muy buenos msicos y de que la produccin es impecable pero las grandes pretensiones del lbum no ocultan el hecho de que ya haban perdido el espritu aventurero del que seguan haciendo gala fripp y sus chicos ni que las letras no son tan profundas como pretenden. es un lbum slido de una calidad indudable pero sin ninguna frescura todo est demasiado calculado.,0
while i love floyd this cd just does not do it for me like some of their other stuff. the purists will tell you that only posers like the wall more than this but i can honestly say that a concept album about going insane is far superior to a non-conceptual cd that has songs that drag on for 3-4 minutes longer than they need to. that being said this album is still worthy of owning and has it is beauties. welcome to the machine has a fitting title as it is almost mechanical in sound and structure while the title track wish you were here is one of the most heartfelt songs of the century. while it is definitely not floyds best and a little on the lengthy side this cd is a good one and should be considered an easy gateway for new fans.,0
roger waters continues his obsession with the ghost of syd barrett.he should get some help and quit sitting on his piles of pounds.,0
this has some nice moments the sung parts of shine on you crazy diamond part one the title track and even have a cigar. unfortunately there are only five songs here and many of them are prolonged with pointless unexciting guitar noodling. it seems as if the boys were out of ideas.,0
good album pink floyd in their prime but i do not pull it out very often. shine on you crazy diamond is in the floyd pantheon of songs and it is quality stuff but i have always felt it was a little long and tended toward the boring side. the whole part 2 of it as they call it - parts vi to ix is rather useless to me it basically just rehashes part one and that was enough for me. have a cigar is a cool song featuring the same funky vibe that floyd used in money and would later use in songs like pigs and young lust. killer synth line too. wish you were here is a classic of course. i personally have always enjoyed the live version on pulse the best it was the first i heard. the menacing welcome to the machine is a nice headphones song with lots of random shrieking keyboards sounds and a mournful-sounding gilmour vocal. overall while i think this album perhaps best captures the classic pink floyd sound it is not the album i pull out most often. animals which i rated 5-stars would hold that honor.,0
as a follow-up to a very well-received and charted and commercially successfull album such as dark side of the moon - wish you were here presents more of the same melodic bluesy space rock for the masses with immaculate crystal-clear production. shine on you crazy diamond 1-5 is a very famous and an alright song featuring simplistic soloing by gilmour sounding emotionally charged but also quite stiff and calculated and a cheesy main theme that would be great as a theme melody for the x-files. it is a great 4-note combination reminds me of black sabbaths 3-note doom dirge but plus one more note to sound more mysterious but after i have heard it for the 1000-th time it becomes quite ordinary. welcome to the machine is a fine and moody depressing ballad about alienation and the woes of the music business which according to roger waters destroyed syd barrett and brought him to madness. have a cigar sounds like an outtake from dark side... - nothing special but still kind of ok. it is pink floyd playing after all. the closing shine on you crazy diamond 6-9 starts with an irritating steel guitar solo i never liked the sound of steel guitar then goes into p-funk territory with some funky groove with synthesizer washes and bits and ends with a some more slower synthy melodies by wright. overall a prety good album which may amaze the more casual music fan. for the ones familiar with the krautrock scene and the developments of the space rock genre both of which to a certain extent derive from pink floyds initial barrett phase this album might seem a bit too safe shiny and pedestrian. the most interesting aspect is by far richard wrights keyboards and all the interesting and innovative sounds that they produce. and finally what is with all this stuff about the evil music business? if it is so bad why did not pink floyd become a rio rock band and why did not they sign to an underground label and make music with kitchenware instrumentation as was the initial plan for a dark side... follow-up?,0
at least they were off to a good start on this one. i want to shine on but i do not feel welcome in the machine i do not want a cigar. concept? maybe...,0
patchy self-indulgent record from a slightly overrated band. hey i like wish you were here as much as the next man but let us face it there some drivel on here too...,0
moving from nonsensical expressive acid-fried weirdness to heavy-handed allegorical space wank was the dumbest thing this band ever did. but it made them millionaires!,0
running over the same old tracks they were not kiddingat first the concept of despaired pessimism worked but by 1975 how many albums had they put out that constantly emphasized how much they hated life.what makes this album even worse was that these songs were mostly digitalif you are going to ask me to choose a concept album then i will take sgt.peppers lonely hearts club band any day over this!,0
this is where i stopped listening to pink floyd. insipid lyrics and boring music. even the album cover artwork is ridiculous.,0
an erratic performance by pink floyd on wish you were here. following on the breakthrough success of dark side of the moon considered by most as their masterpiece the band seemed to have rushed this together. it reminds me in a way of meddle in that the songs do not flow together well. as individual songs they are good but as a whole the album does not mesh as well as other releases. you could say the band has a chronic problem if you want to call it a problem with erratic music as piper... meddle and wish you were here all have it. anyway the album follows two main intermeshed themes. mostly it is a tribute album to former founding member syd barrett. the second or minor theme deals with what the band thinks of the record industry. this second theme can be intertwined with the first if you assume the band blames the industry for syds illicit drug use that drove him over the edge. in other words the fame and recognition syd receives as pink floyd becomes more and more known was the catalyst. add in the resulting stress from the pressure the industry would put on his creative processes with deadlines to fill and contracts to adhere to and you get the picture of what floyd would put on this album. i spoke earlier of the erratic nature of this album. like echoes is for meddle shine on you crazy diamond is the backbone and heart of wish you were here. the band broke it up into two parts with the first starting off the album and the second finishing it. after listening to the album repeatedly you realize they should have kept it together and placed at the end like on meddle with echoes. the reason can only be assumed that it was to distinguish it from meddle or to give the album a more cohesive whole as the 3 sandwiched songs could not drive the album on their own. the angst ridden insult toward the record industry that welcome to the machine is does not mesh well musically with shine on... even though it works from a theme based standpoint. the electronic sound of an industrial fan and overall feeling of machinery even with the acoustic guitar playing does not mix well with the sax by dick parry and other instrumentation and airy feeling of shine on.... in fact if you include wish you were here and have a cigar the former being another song about syd waters is having mixed feeling of the success of pink floyd as barrett who was instrumental in this success is not there to enjoy it with him and the latter is another insult to the record industry the 3 middle songs seem like additions to fill out the rest of the time that shine on... did not absorb. do not get me wrong have a cigar considered the worse of the songs on the record does have the theme embedded in it and of the three songs meshes the best with shine on... except that you hear guest vocals by british folk artist roy harper but it is not exactly there. neither is wish you were here although again it meshes with the theme. the reduction in the volume output at the end of have a cigar and at the beginning of wish... with the short conversation between a man and woman and commencement of of the acoustic guitar does not work well. it is not surprising that you hear these three songs on the radio more than any other songs by floyd with the exception of money and time from dark side... as i think the band or capital wanted to continue the success of dark side... with radio exposure. taken as singles each song is great and i enjoy all of them especially welcome to the machine one of my all time favourite floyd songs but as a whole they do not make wish you were here a coherent record musically. the output of pink floyd that commenced with meddle and ended with the wall is personally my favourite period from the band and wish you were here is an integral part of that era. it just is not my favourite floyd record.,0
this album shows the evolution of pink floyd from old guitar amplifiers to newer and crisper guitars and amplifiers recording equipment and a new recording label. it looks like they are set back a couple steps and try to learn how to render their instruments so they sound well with together which is not a bad thing but can make a listener bored like me. the whole synthesizer instrument for a keyboard was sharp and overriding and does not work well with their arrangements. shine on you crazy diamond obviously is roger reflecting on syd. in fact the album can be viewed in the light that roger is reflecting on syd. welcome to the machine have a cigar and wish you were here are good indications. too bad there is nothing here that even rivals their previous album dark side of the moon.,0
well this is my first pink floyd album. i do not know why it is taken me such a long time to finally hear one i guess i was just put off my a lot of their later overproduced pretentious stuff mostly from the wall- i will be sure to avoid that one. well this one is still slightly overproduced but only a wee bit pretentious and i do not mind a bit of pretension once in a while. i guess the title track was the only one that had any real effect on me but rest of it was fine- the two parts of shine on you crazy diamond just breezed by nicely welcome to the machine was a little overdone but still effective and even have a cigar which seems to be the weakest track by wide consensus was pretty good. altogether a strong if slightly overrated album it has not inspired me to check out everything pink floyd have done but i will give some of their other stuff a go.,0
4 songs that is not an album! its a lazy bunch of good musicians with no idea what to do next! perhaps if someone in the studio spoke-up and said...guys how about we chop crazy diamond into 6 minutes and write 4 more tunes then pink floyd would have had another masterpiece. but instead the guy in the editing room called in sick and they let self-absorbed demo-quality experimentation go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on... perhaps my point is made by now?...mr. waters said no...and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. what a bore. what a waste. such a lazy misfire at the peak of their talents. psychadelic my arse. the sound of water dripping is more creative than this. metaphorically i feel sorry for welcome to the machine cigar and whish you were here...these songs deserve better than to be sandwiched between obese boring shine on parts 1 and 2. should have been named shine on and on and on you lazy diamonds. cannot give more than 2.5 stars for half an album.,0
wish you were here was comparatively similar to the dark side of the moon but it was not as coherent. the overall feeling of the album is oddly disjointed but it is still good despite this. highlights include wish you were here  shine on you crazy diamond.,0
ahhh wish you were here is an average album. wish you were here have a cigar and welcome ot the machine are all good songs yet the other 2 shine on you crazy12 seriusly brought them down. floyd has definatly done better.,0
unfortunatly over rated. which is a shame because this is a fucking great album that i should give a 4. but in light of the popular cheese feel this album as i am forced to give it 3.5 sorry rodge. the track wish you were here probably houses my favourite song lyrics in the world ever p.,0
with the high esteem in the court of the crimson king is held it almost seems to be an obligatory listen. i have given it several listens just to be fair coz the first time around i thought it was shit. it is true that 21st century schizoid man was groundbreakingly heavy for 1969 and it drives along well for a couple of minutes before a really bad speed wobble and spin out. it finally gets back on track but the ride was ruined. next up i talk to the wind is the shortest track at a mere six minutes. it is a quiet affair dominated by flute and organ and for the most part is incredibly dull. epitaph brings welcome relief with a touch of variation and drama and greg lake actually portrays some emotion a true highlight. i am a little torn when it comes to moonchild. i am not sure whether it is the musical equivalent of taking five separate doodlings and attempting to construct a piece of fine art from them or the product of five musicians beating each other off. yes it is an absolute wankfest and i would rather listen to revolution 9 repeatedly or stick pins in my eyes than ever bear this again. if i ever see the words free and improvisation together again i will know when to run away. fortunately the court of the crimson king comes to a merciful rescue with some beautiful vocal harmonies to get lost in. it is a delightful piece. overall though i have difficulty reconciling the albums current lofty standing with its much more moderate success upon release. maybe i am missing something but i am not going to bother looking any more especially at that cover art. yuk!,0
like crash bandicoot warped 100 memory card save files of full relic completion are passed down from generation to generation the king crimson vinyl of thus debut has been passed down unto me via one generation of slaving to buy it at a car boot sale one day. i plug it into the glory hole of the back-end of a flouting disc jockey to be revealed a world of slam-dunk dairylea cheese triangles. 21st century derren brown bursts on like chocolate thunder ice cream and funks up in a saxophone doubled guitar sound that is both crunchy and polymerised for a smack of golden pangos. you hear the echo of some guy who forgot to pay for a lottery ticket as he exhales in anger in syncopated time to the instrumentation. then they make jam for a few hours with the jazz club. lightning fast stop-and-gos like the go-gos got no beat as they burn through the driveway at 22mph. only stopping to go into all out squeeadly deedly because they watched the newest episode of strong bad. i talk to the wind is the little gem in the spyro year of the dragon. heavily flute based and serenely hippy in calmness it brings about pictures of sitting in a medieval village discussing politics and if we truly find hairy legs smell attractive. the jam is melodious and sweet this time and i prefer it as the singer sounds like a door that needs to reverse itself outside of the closet into nostalgic spy air. perdodious. as the epitaph approaches we are lead into the morose cataclysms of mellotron that shoves us into zetsubou. the chorus shouting into a bass thump that manages to bump a goose into one and other but being awkwardly nihilistic in my head as i fear that tomorrow i will be crying. i forgot the leek. moonchild is when i left the jam outside and there was too much. the jam constantly fornicated with itself until breeding a super army of jam. this jam then continued to force itself onto the villagers. pillaging them all down one by one until i got the high score. that title track manages to get a perfect balance. the kingdom has been saved and we are a pe. the king screams because his face is red and he does not like having a red face!!! i guess it was too prog for him.,0
it is fucking ridiculous how much more i like i talk to the wind than anything else on this record. i talk to the wind makes me think of long sweet melancholic nights spent reading poetry under full moons and lost rolling hills over which i rollicked eternally with fairies before waking up alone again reaching laughingly for summer and what it should be for the streets when they are empty near campus for mornings when i can scarcely tell you about all the things i saw all the lost things streaked with syrupy pastel. the other four are like having a smelly uncle ,0
so this is the legendary progressive album that the ratings and most critics have been so generous to. i have heard of kings crimson and looked into them to see what all the hype was about. my musical taste are always expanding and i always crave successfully pulled off cutting edge sounds that will knocked me off my feet. by successfully i mean it is still good music in that it has listen-ability you know the stuff that has you tapping your foot and whistle the tune later that day. you know what kind of music i cannot stand? music that wastes my time. there is a lot of good music out there and i want to hear it! i do not like feeling like i am listening to a film sound track without visual footage to accompaniment it. even worse are pretentious musicians who start out with solid sounding material then throw it all out with long slow dull and drawn out jams with little going on but subtle noises and minimalistic attempt at evoking atmosphere with spacy notes. i had a feeling that is exactly what this would be which is why i have avoided it so long. well i took a chance with it anyway come to find it was simply alright. the album starts off with a kick in the balls looked like it was going to be the album everyone said it was! from start to finish a progressive rock masterpiece! unfortunately it does not continue. the next song is not terrible it is just slow and soft which i do not particular care flutes tootin throughout the song without much more going on would not dismiss this song becuase i can see how some people could enjoy it for falling asleep or something. the is alright again slow and soft going for that classically induced atmospheric feel i see. makes me think of waves crashing on a beautiful beach with a light house but the mood indicates something bad just happened. great vocals here the instruments kind of take the back seat here and do not do anything tremendous even when greg lake is not singing. the next song does exactly what i do not like to hear in music as described above. starts off good then gets duller as the music does not seem to change until everything slows down and leaves you hung up listening to experimental noises beee booop... booop beee... xylophone riff.... .....bee boop .... get to the fucking point!! if you have got something worthwhile to record then only record what is worthwhile do not add all this extra fluff to drag the song out this is one of the biggest flaws i find in progressive rock and where my bias for long songs come from. if a song must be long have a purpose for it i.e. when the musics over by the doors or jazz music that features solos and well executed improvisation jams not this shit. finally in the court of the crimson king. this song is also rather good and i would place this as second best but still a long stretch from 21st century schizoid man. this is one of the few songs where the artist successfully demonstrates the imagery they want to evoke it really does sound like you are in the court of the crimson king whatever the fuck that is! full of expression and imagery. over the course of rating this album i have come to appreciate it more and see how some people with great patience can tolerate or enjoy most of this album. for the most part it is too slow and boring for me. maybe i will warm up to it some more though will keep listening to king crimson for i know their potential from the stellar track 21st century schizoid man.,0
i love crimson but it always aggravates me that this is always voted their best album when its plainly not. i put it down to peoples basic ignorance of their back catalogue. firstly the production even with the new re-master is pretty dull and stodgy even by 1969 standards. the album kicks off nicely with schizoid man but everything thereafter gets into a more pastoral vein. in the court of the crimson king is a nice track but the production let us it down and i am surprised that crimson never re-visited this track on further albums cos it could definately have done with an overhaul because of the lumpy sound. the definative version of schizoid man appears on 1974s live usa album and quite simply walks all over the original. this is a landmark album for sure - there was simply nothing else like schizoid man in 1969 though the remainder of the tracks are generally uninspired but there is much better stuff out there even though crimson have always been a very frustrating band being as all their albums suffer from hot and cold moments -the aforementioned usa album is generally pretty damn great though and you cannot go wrong with that. 2003s the power to believe has 3 tracks on it that are among the heaviest music ever created. the jewel in the crown though is 1974s red album. real mind-blowing stuff. start on any of those before going to this album.,0
i tried i swear i did. i do not get it. i know that this is one of those huge albums that everyone says is important. i would not dare say it is bad i just do not hear what everyone else is hearing. there were moments that i enjoyed but then it would break off into some other direction and it was very jarring. i appreciate that these noises were made on purpose and in a particular sequence but i only hear sounds rather than music.,0
would it be terrible to admit that while listening to 21st century schizoid man the first thought that popped in my mind was man this sounds like mars volta? haha i am so young. take away the mindless meandering of moonchild and this is a completely solid album. epitaph is just...fucking sweet lord. i am pretty sure listening to that and the moody blues nights in white satin back-to-back violates some clauses of the geneva convention. the one that says something about how combining the two songs in too short a time frame is equivalent to testing some sort of atomic bomb of absolutely fucking overwhelming sadness and melodrama.,0
i can appreciate why people like prog but beyond some of the krautrock stuff it is a genre that i just do not care for much. i dled this out of curiousity i mean it is regarded extremely highly but it reminds me of spinal tap circa stonehenge era in places especially moonchild and i talk to the wind! 21st century schizoid man has some interesting free-jazz freak-out moments but then there is some extremely wanky guitar playing that reminds me that the mars volta were probably inspired by this song....and tmv are just too busy. i like my rock without unicorns and fire witches. besides robert fripp went on to make much more interesting music with brian eno....,0
great fun and it was very thoughtful of them to give us time for a tea-break in the middle of moonchild.,0
somehow i managed to avoid hearing anything by king crimson throughout the whole of my school years which must be something of a record given they were the darlings of the student population. in fact it was not until the height of the punk revolution that i heard the seminal 21st century schizoid man and because it was new to me it sounded fresh and innovative and worth a punt. king crimson arrived on the scene when any idealistic notions of peace and love had been forever tainted by world events and bad publicity. their take on the dinosaur that psychedelia had become was to grab the drug-induced soundscapes of the music and drag them kicking and screaming into a more cynical world. except listening again they themselves wimped out. songs like i talk to the wind and moonchild already sounded as if they belong to a world of the dim and distant past. additionally pete sinfields lyrics - much beloved when first released - appear to have great depth and meaning but are probably nothing more than word necklaces strung together merely for effect. finally the preternaturally quiet doodling on moonchild are signs the band are having trouble wrapping it up rather than carrying any profound meaning. in the court of the crimson king is good value but it is not the messianic transcript that most see it as.,0
july 10 2008 i really do want to like this album. as a whole king crimson is a decent band and quite a few of their other songs i have heard are worth listening to. but in the court of the crimson king as a whole falls short. 21st century schizoid man is a great opener and a good song. it is nicely proggy and i like the sax section and jazzy bass. but after that the album completely falls flat. i talk to the wind is after a few minutes in which it has already said everything it can just flute wankery and gets really boring as the song goes absolutely nowhere. epitaph is alright a little more interesting but not much. it is also too long and only really gets going at about seven minutes in which is about five minutes after i have lost my patience for the song. and then... we have moonchild. oh god moonchild. it is twelve minutes of nothing at all. well it may as well be. i can appreciate improvisational stuff like this but here it just does not make any sense at all. and for free improv it is not even very good. finally we get to the the title track and the only other decent song on the whole album. you know this would have made a great ep. just the first and last tracks and you would be set. none of the wankery none of the improv none of the pointless songs just two decent prog tracks and it would have gotten at least a 3 from me. oh well.,0
parmi les grands mystres de l univers il y a les gens qui considrent que les improvisations jazz sont ennuyeuses et qui prennent trs au srieux le trs trs laborieux et carrment embarrassant moonchild avec ses vagues relents de fake moyen age sucr et cette impro hyper poussive qui meuble pniblement 9 minutes dans ce pensum. cette daube numro 1 de 1969 ? alors qu il y a trout mask replica uncle meat ou mme carrment ligeti si on veut un truc vraiment audacieux et progressif ? et la lourdeur des percus introduisant epitaph ce plonasme motionnel cheapo tragique ou au moins les paroles ne trahissent pas la musique. daube solennelle sotte et prtentieuse. misre.,0
i listened to this album without knowing anything about the history of the persons of this band. for the life of me i cannot fathom how this album is rated so highly and i generally agree with the other albums in these top lists.,0
i cannot deny their ambition and skill but this is not what i want to listen to. the improvisations are not interesting the lyrics piss me off. it all sounds cinematic in a way i do not like so this is a no for me.,0
it is an ambitious debut with new sounds and some good themes and melodies and some rooky mistakes. according to consensus it is a milestone the start of a musical tradition. i like to listen to it every now and then maybe once per decade. and i like the balads i talk to the wind and epitaph. i like them better then the two large prog tracks even if the schizoid man has good clarity and guts. the court is also good but it lingers for too long.,0
whether you have listened to this album or not you have no doubt seen the iconic cover art floating around the internet more than a few times i know i certainly have. the first track very aggressive cartoon music? did not like the second track peaceful forest music? lovely flute playing here. did like the third track boring pop rock with a random pointless crescendo? i suppose this one does have a bit of lite symphonic stuff going on but it really is not engaging or interesting to listen to. did not like the fourth track this one gets a bit of hate and i can see why. the very promising and pleasant track ends after about two and a half minutes and the almost ten minutes that remain consists of random soft improvisational instrumentation. did not like the fifth track now i understand why the fourth track is on this album- to make the other tracks seem much more interesting than they really are. but they are only comparatively more interesting. so this is another symphonic rock thing which is kind of a combination of tracks two and three. probably the second best track on the album. mildly liked overall this album is quite disappointing.,0
giving this a 3 because of 21st century schizoid man. would have been lower if not for the song. i enjoyed epitaph and the title track too. nonetheless the album is overrated according to me. there is no way its the 3rd best album ever for sure. it is amazing to create this in 1969 but it is too basic for my liking. love the flutes though.,0
21st century schizoid man is great the jazz-rock is fun to listen to. but the point of contention in most reviews is moonchild and to a much lesser extent i talk to the wind and i feel like not enough of them are interacting with it on its own terms i.e. as free improvisation so i am mostly going to talk about those and also i am breaking out the section headers so i do not have to write a transition between the two. i. i talk to the wind is it an interesting opinion to say that i talk to the wind is the misstep here? i guess i understand the juxtaposition effect that they are going for but also epitaph fulfills that same need without requiring everything to grind to a halt. and honestly my bigger issue is that it preemptively ruins the improvisation on moonchild but i could not figure out how to word that without it sounding unintelligibly clunky. but just because i do not like i talk to the wind on the meta level does not mean that i dislike the track itself the songwriting is stupid sure and i do mean that in the traditional sense but when have i been one to complain about that? and i find the twee-prog aesthetic kind of endearing you know? ii. moonchild i like my free improvisation to sound deliberatethat is i want to be fairly confident that it was a conscious choice on behalf of the songwriters and not a failed jam session. usually you will get some kind of fast section with lots of runs to give the instrumentalists a chance to prove their mettle or perhaps more commonly they will incorporate it into the main motif. i think the rest of the album is supposed to provide that here? only it does not really work because all that does is assure me that the band can play through-composed musicnot that they can improvise. so once we get past the power ballad section of the song there is some incredibly timid noodling and because i have not really been primed for free improvisation i hear groom asks to play with the band at the wedding or less cynically four musicians goofing around in a practice room instead and that is fine but it does not sound like free improvisation that has anything to say and i cannot tell if it was intended to.,0
this album is consistently hailed as one of the greatest of all time by pretty much everyone in the internet space. while i understand it is aesthetic significance because well it sounds like it was released about 20 years later than it actually was as someone hearing it for the first time in 2021 it is age and cheap tactics for seeming grandiose and epic are extremely obvious. while the album is still enjoyable and far from bad putting it anywhere near a top 10 of all time list is kind of ridiculous to me. my main issue with this album is the technicality for the sake of itself. the band themselves have even admitted that at times they would add more random stuff to the album for show to further show off their technicality. this flaw really gets in the way of a lot of the songwriting. there is random bells and whistles everywhere drum solos and just generally non-musical pieces that really take away from the songwriting. i can imagine a version of this album that focuses less on showing off the - admittedly very impressive - talents of the band members and i think i would enjoy that a lot more. all that being said i still have an overall positive review of the album. there is no denying the colossal nature of the soundscapes and songwriting choices here. to start we have 21st century schizoid man. this song is a full-blown auditory metaphor for mania for the great majority of it is runtime. the primary riff is strange and off-kilter though i am not a huge fan of the harsh sound of the higher-pitched saxophone passages. the large breakdown section in the middle has a lot of the over-technicality that i talked about earlier - the part with the snare drums and saxophones simultaneously starting and stopping at random is particularly guilty. the next track i talk to the wind is a dramatic change of mood from the previous track. this track is easily one of my favorites it let us the beautiful songwriting and playing take center stage in a non-indulgent way. the song is essentially a vocal section followed by an extended flute solo - and i do not think it needs anything else. great track. epitaph is perhaps the least memorable track here but still a cool ride - it is use of deeper-toned instruments in the instrumental sections adds a lot of power to the song. it also builds to a great outro but at the end simply fades out which is a bit of a bummer. moonchild is the worst track on the album as pretty much anyone could tell you. the brief part that is actually musical at the beginning of the song is fine but then comes an extremely pretentious instrumental section that consists of only the band playing random little licks for almost 10 minutes - 10 minutes!!!!! it is ridiculous boring and laughable. the album at least ends with a bang - the court of the crimson king is a really cool track for the most part. the vocals are epic the backing aids that feeling and the flute solo is especially cool. the only real downside is the ending that is trying wayyyy too hard to be epic. it stops at where it should actually end goes into a quieter section and then suddenly explodes again into an encore of the chorus before exploding into a noisier section and finally ending - all really eye-rolling attempts at extending the run time and showing off. although i have a lot of problems with this album the reasons that it is considered a classic are not hidden. it is a groundbreaking and impressive album truly ahead of its time and the underlying pretentiousness of it was probably a result of the pretentious nature of a group of people that would be able to push the boundary this far. i still enjoyed it greatly and can look past some of those issues when i am really getting sucked into the world that this album tries to create. strong 710,0
shit sounds like cavemen just discovered instruments and decided to make a shitty prog rock album,0
i think i have forgotten how to properly lay out a review by now but because this is an undisputed classic and the third best album oat according to the site i do not think people are looking for an extensively developed and probably unoriginal opinion or take on king crimsons game-changing 1969 record in the court of the crimson king anyway. thus i will press forward with this mess of a stream of consciousness. is this the album that holds both 21st century schizoid man and epitaph tight within its tracklist? why yes yes it is. damn me if that is not one perfect a-sideb-side combo. as i have grown out of 21st a bit and gotten more into the phenomenal melody lyricism and progression on epitaph as time went by i will give the latter all the praise i can give an old prog song the likes of this very tune. epitaph is brilliant. it is everything i expect from a progressive song of its nature it is not overly technical and off-putting which is something i could maybe critique 21st century schizoid man for its instrumentation is actually pretty its crescendos are grandiose its transition passagesmoments actually add to the songs power rather than making the whole song sound extremely long and boring its lyrics have some incredibly resonant and terrific lines it is topline makes the song what it is. for all i could compliment epitaph it is the brilliance of the melody just how fucking catchy and earworm-worthy it is just how much of a i will not leave your head for the next hour it amounts to be what actually makes this a perfect song. if greg lake had sung the song just the way he sings it with the same words but the melody had been anything but what it is the song would be torn to shambles. epitaph melody-wise is extremely one-note. there are not many variations other than perhaps lakes voice going an octave higher the second time he sings the melody and yet the song comes out anything but repetitive. the interlude halfway through is pretty as can be and when those bombarding cascading drum hits come back down on you you know you will be singing your lungs out to the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall on which the proooooophets wrote is crackiiiiiiing at the seaaaaaaams for the next few seconds. holy fuck. this is how you do timeless music. do not go the extra mile unless you have got a melody that can warrant repeated listens on its own that is not even counting the beautiful progression of the track itself. oh right. there is other songs on this thing as well. moonchild is incredibly pretty until it becomes incredibly awful and a song that makes you wonder what the fuck the people that think this album is perfect are on about. the second half is nothing! nothing happens! at all! thankfully i talk to the wind is albeit relatively simple quite pretty as well. one of the tracks that emphasizes that symphonic aspect of the album the most. the flute bits are really nice to listen to. the court of the crimson king i feel works as a closer maybe...? and it is one of my preferred tracks out of these 5 top 3 to be precise but i feel it falls a bit flat by the 4th time the in the court of the crimson kiiiiiiiiing comes around. i still enjoy it though. of course 21st century schizoid man although many might believe it to be the band throwing everything at you even if some of the fast playing whether it be the guitar the drums or others comes off as a show-off rather than anything of substance i just think is perfect. the middle section actually makes me enjoy the song even more rather than making me wish the band would just go back to the chorus. which is something weird for me to experience when it comes to prog-rock. perhaps the instant takeaway from the record i have now come to enjoy it just a bit less than i did before but by no means do i think it is lost its magic. it is a perfect song in my book well the 445 version is anyway. given the amount of space dedicated to the third song on the tracklist when compared to the other songs combined i guess i just wrote this review to churn out what i think about epitaph. and i think that is more than fine. this album should be renamed epitaph and other prog-rock songs that amount to just about an lps length. oh and the silent bit at the start of 21st century schizoid man is completely unnecessary. radio edit rules supreme. but anyways. stream epitaph.,0
been a long time probably like 7 or 8 years since i have listened to this. it was always an album that never had anything that brought me back. on the re-listen - 21st century schizoid man rocks especially in the context of music in 1969. - i talk to the wind is the best song on the record for me the woodwind and electric piano is total bliss to me. after these two songs though i really just do not care that much about the album. - the strings in epitaph are nice and the songwriting itself is not bad but it is not exciting enough for me to want to ever relisten although the last minute of the song is nice but not quite nice enough for me to want to sit through the meandering. - moonchild has a nice vocal melody but the instruments are just bleh and then it just goes into the most boring unnecessary dicking around i have ever heard. i hate the latter 34s of moonchild so much it brings the album down a whole point for me. awful contrast to the epic parts of the album. - the court of the crimson king is good but there was much more interesting things going on in music that it does not do much for me. a little too repetitive in a bit of an annoying way for me kind of like a fever-induced thought loop. despite my gripes it is significance cannot be ignored and i get why people cream their pants over it so to speak. it just personally is not as sexy to me though.,0
schizoid man is obviously brilliant and insane the rest sounds like the soundtrack to a monty python film. that old prog trick of putting a really cool track near the beginning and then letting your roger waters analog do his louis ck impression through the next 40 minutes conceptually speaking of course - no i will say no this time.,0
albums like this are more of a work of art than a collection of songs making it harder to rate than most records. what i can say is that the parts of this album that are good are pretty damn good. it peaks for me during epitaph although the court of the crimson king does not lag too far behind. and of course the classic 21st century schizoid man is great too. a good chunk of the album though is a bit too out there for my liking though works of art are not always completely palatable i guess. overall though in the court of the crimson king is a decent listen and a truly influential album. 3.5 pretty good,0
no doubt this album was revolutionary for 1969 and helped pave the way for the progressive rock take over however i feel it is very much a love hate relationship i have with this album for the most part it is enjoyable and unique but some of it is dull and boring.. its definitely a must too listen but i do not believe it deserves to be 3rd best of all time. highlights21st century schizoid man epitaph talk to the wind,0
this is a tough one but i have to say that this is on the lower end of king crimsons discography for me and i am still giving it 3.5 stars. not that it is a bad record by any means but as albums go the band only went up from here. with the love this album gets i think it has potential to be one of the most overrated albums of all time. this is a great starting point for the band however and shows people just how creative fripp can be. it was monumental for 1969 and is without a doubt one of the most influential records of all time. the drumming by michael giles is incredible greg lakes voice is just as good as any other work of his and the atmosphere in songs such as epitaph is astounding. this album would be much better if not for moonchild. i do not care what other people say the improv section absolutely ruins this album. not that it even is bad necessarily but it is just wayyyy too long. oddly the improv section is longer than most of the songs and unfortunately creates such an interference from the rest of the tracklist. while i think king crimson has better stuff and that this album does not flow the best the highs off of the title track epitaph and 21st century schizoid man will blow you away and at times make you forget about the atrocity of moonchild. any rock fan needs to listen to this record and just sink into that mellotron!,0
this album as a whole is cool but i do not enjoy it. i like the idea of everything that is going on here but something about the repeating saxophones or the extremely dragged out moments on this album are really not that enjoyable as cool as they are for it is time. take my favorite track moonchild. the song as a whole is amazing and the textured sounds that come afterwards are very fitting and enjoyable but they did not need to be nearly 6 minutes long. i have a lot of respect for this album but honestly it is not that replayable.,0
cover is the best part,0
the sound on this is quite bad but that seems to be a pretty consistent problem with early prog. other than the opener this merely reaches the realms of solid never really transcending into the mythical realm where so many put this. the opening section of moonchild comes close though.,0
king crimson were one of the first progressive rock bands. they took what was in the air from jazz-rock and baroque pop especially the key album days of future passed and transformed it into a new style. robert fripp and others wanted to establish rock music as a serious art something for which you could wear good suits. the collection is uneven but clearly shows the direction his artistry would take. 21st century schizoid man including mirrors of course is the big shot of the album it excells in guitar virtuosity memorable riffs and even was being sampled by kanye west. the lyrics by peter sinfield paint an apocalyptic world in typical late 60s-fashion but everything else was highly original for its time. the foundation of the track is jazz-rock but the scope musicality and tight composition was new. robert fripp one of the greatest rock musicians of all time presents his sustain-heavy virtuoso guitar style to the world. another key element is the saxophone and the jazzy drums. the lead riff is so disctinctive it essentially became a meme for big badass prog rock. i talk to the wind sounds like a standard baroque pop ballad and does not carry the momentum of the phenomenal opener. to this day i prefer my king crimson when it is ridiculously heavy and riff-tastic. fripp did not pen this but winds player and keyboardist ian mcdonald and the style is almost jarringly different. the next composition is much superior the majestic epitaph including march for no reason and tomorrow and tomorrow. the key instrument of the song is the mellotron an instrument so distinctive you will immediatly recognize its sound. it was brought in as necessity as a real orchestra was too expensive. it became a signature element of the band and the formula of the grandiose mellotron rock ballad would later be perfected by the bands own starless on red. moonchild including the dream and the illusion is a base breaker it begins with a beautiful minimal ballad. it is unusually melodic for king crimson and appears like a lullaby. after a little more than two minutes however it turns into a freely improvised piece that to this day will offend listeners. i personally found it failed and later improvisations like providence were much better. the court of the crimson king including the return of the fire witch and the dance of the puppets is another ian mcdonald-led baroque pop ballad. it is much better than i talk to the wind and the mellotron compensates for much of the lack of crazy fripp antics. when the album is over you really wished for more of those riff-heavy insanity of the opener and thankfully the wish will be granted on the mid-70s wettonbrufordfripp trilogy of albums which i vastly prefer. compared to later releases this album appears almost simple-minded as robert fripp would create the weirdest things in the future such as larks tongues in aspic and become a tier-a sideman in rock for the likes of david bowie. soon frippo would be in absolute control over the group and recruite even better musicians for his vision. of course i also have to mention the glorious cover art. it is the 21th century schizoid man according to fripp and it is based off a paining by barry godber a friend of peter sinfield. 7.510,0
in the court of the crimson king is a bona fide masterpiece. absolutely fucking genius. possibly the best album of the 1960s. has to be heard to be believed. the only thing holding this back is the improvisation on moonchild. other than that it is perfect. 9.410,0
in the court of the crimson king points out the dilemma underlying rock criticism. criticism should be founded on a bedrock of logic and reason but as an aggregated rating of 4.31  5 clearly shows a whole lot of people love this album and therefore cease to be objective. i am guilty of it myself of course. i have tried to get into prog. i just cannot. as psychedelia morphed into prog at the end of the sixties it lost the magic for me. i can listen to this album and objectively appreciate most of the tracks as daring and innovative but the album as a whole --and prog in general -- still strikes me as cold and bombastic. in the court of the crimson king is probably a better album from a technical standpoint than behold  see but it lacks the warmth and quiet resignation that has compelled me to listen to that album for decades before and for decades to come. my mind likes a lot of in the court of the crimson king my heart however is indifferent. and so as i bring down this albums impressive rating by just a hair know that i have tried to be as objective as possible. the poet robert browning once wrote mans reach should exceed his grasp. that sentiment seems true of both the albums contents and my attempt to adequately review them.,0

clearly in the court of the crimson king is a historically important work. as a yes fan i recognize the unlikelihood that close to the edge would exist without the influence of in the court of the crimson king. along with van der graaf generators early work the use of syncopated reed-instrument parts on in the court of the crimson king would be emulated by bands for years. beyond that this album seems to have prefigured a whole strain of non-blues-based heavy prog and i have to believe it is a progenitor of many works by progressive metal bands. but while in the court of the crimson king has been one of the most influential progressive rock albums ever the album and the band is not without its own influences some of which to me seem fairly clear. for example the heavier songs owe a debt to in-a-gadda-da-vida and to groups like vanilla fudge. there are also echoes so to speak of pink floyd in these songs as well as in some of the experimental sections of the album. parts of i talk to the wind sounds a little like traffic and all of epitaph sounds a lot like the moody blues. nonetheless in the court of the crimson king is an original amalgam of a number of styles as a whole it is anything but derivative. in the court of the crimson king relies as much on production as on composition or musicianship and the production is superb. fripps use of effects on vocals and instruments is appropriately offbeat. the sound quality is also top-notch. in terms of sound the edition i am reviewing herethe fortieth anniversary cd with the 2009 steven wilson  robert fripp remixessounds like it was recorded yesterday. in terms of mixing it does not vary radically from versions of these songs on the 21st century guide to king crimsonvolume one 1969-1974 which contains nearly the entirety of in the court of the crimson king. the performances range from good to very good and rarely detract from the listening experience. the only exception is the vocal harmonizing on i talk to the wind which wavers off-key a bit too much for my taste. while michael giless drumming is good throughout it is occurred to me more than once that it made sense that king crimson bandleader robert fripp would eventually covet bill bruford for the band. the relative weakness of in the court of the crimson king is in its composition. the quality of the songwriting is within the normal range for artistic rock of the period. i acknowledge that peter sinfields lyrics are more sophisticated than were those of nearly any rock lyricist of the time but like neil pearts early works each clever turn of phrase is matched by an equally clumsy one elsewhere. repeated listens have illuminated aspects of the presentation of the songs on in the court of the crimson king but for me have not deepened my understanding of the composition. recognizing that i am in the minority here i am assigning this album two and a half stars. it is hard to say that an album as important as in the court of the crimson king is not essential which is how some people define a three-star rating. this album has been essential to the development of steven wilson andy tillison and many other great modern prog musicians. but as a part of a prog-rock record collection i would suggest first purchasing one of the bands 1980s albums with adrian belew or perhaps red king crimsons last 1970s album.,0
i am living in that 21st century doing something mean to it do it better than anybody you ever seen do it screams from the haters got a nice ring to it i guess every superhero need his theme music no one man should have all that power the clocks ticking i just count the hours stop tripping i am tripping off the power 21st century schizoid man inizia cos power di kanye west perla contenuta nellalbum - a mio avviso - pi grosso del decennio scorso. con il sample della canzone dei king crimson. i think it was really me him and the engineer and he was working on his asr-10 sampler going through samples while the song was playing over and over to see what would fit ricorda s1 producer di kanye in unintervista a rolling stone. i was right beside him while he was doing it and he came across this king crimson sample and as soon as he hit the key it triggered the sample and it came in right on the right spot of the song and we looked at each other like oh  that is crazy. so he started chopping it and getting the sample to fit exactly right aggiunge il producer. and every time he would hit it it was just this magic that was happening. leggenda narra che una volta scelta la base kanye lavor 5.000 ore sul testo e che lo stesso testo fu fortemente influenzato da quel sample. sempre s1 afferma once he put that in the song it became such a moment of the song that i am sure that had some type of influence on the lyrics. effettivamente al di l del verso i am living in the 21st century il testo di kanye con i suoi riferimenti al razzismo istituzionalizzato the system broken the school is closed the prisons open e il tempo che sta per scadere the clocks ticking i just count the hours  til then fuck that the worlds ours sembrano riflessi contemporanei della profezia oscura originale di peter sinfield. questo pippotto per dire che questo album ha unimportanza capitale non solo per leffetto che avr sulla generazione colta del post-punk ma anche per quello che avr sulla musica contemporanea. vedi kanye. detto questo io odio il prog rock non lo reggo. per se c un badate bene uno solo album prog che posso ascoltare  proprio questo. purtroppo per il resto sono proprio lontano anni luce da quellestetica fatta di folletti flauti maghi e foreste per qui - specialmente grazie al primo pezzo - lo posso sopportare.,0
this album is hard to describe. first off we start off with what is no doubt the best song on the album. this could be one of the best rock songs in the 60s. of course the song being talked about is 21st century schizoid man. the intro to the song is great and the verses are too. but it does not just stop there. we get into the fast solo section. the drums are packed and the drum solo is packed as well the horns just keep going and going and the expected guitar solo brings out the unexpected somehow. it is a very great song and i can listen to it any day of the year. however this should have been in like the middle of the album and maybe king crimson should have had taken a song out of the current album and create a song like this because... ...the rest of the album is... ...fine? epitaph is a pretty great song. the chorus brings out great emotion and feel. however i cannot really say the same for i talk to the wind. even while being the shortest song on the album i just do not see it being a high point on the album. it felt longer than epitaph to be honest. i talk to the wind is just alright. the song could be better if it was seasonal or something. honestly moonchild goes on for way too long. while the actual song is pretty good the intro kind of reminds me of shangri-la by the kinks moonchild and the court of the crimson king should have been equal length or maybe moonchild could take the extra minutes it had and just scrap it altogether. the court of the crimson king is an okay song though. it is a pretty good introduction to prog rock but i would not go to an extent that it is one of the best. 3.55,0
never been a huge fan of progressive rock. i see its merits but in my opinion the albums are often overly long and lacking in a lot of what i enjoy in music. i care little for virtuoso musical ability if the music said talent produces is not enjoyable for me to listen to. that is why i do not listen to much classical music. sure mozart is a musical genius with immense talent but his music is immensely boring to me. as the fathers of progressive rock one would assume then that i greatly dislike them but that really is not the case. more often than not i enjoy what i hear from this band but there are many instances where their songs get a bit lost in the sauce. the amazingly catchy melodies can disappear for minutes on end as the band members engage in performative wankery with their respective instruments. some people get into that kind of stuff and that is awesome but it just is not for me. the album starts out with an amazing song 21st century schizoid man. this is the type of stuff i love from king crimson. the melody is strong and dominant and the instrumentation is tight. each member is playing in perfect harmony and unison with the other and even at times when that harmony is disrupted it is a careful disruption that only adds to the song. i talk to the wind is another solid track. it is not as good as the opener but it is a nice little song that acts as a great transition from the hyperintensity of the opener and the slightly mellowed nature of the next track epitaph. moonchild just is not good. i like the first three minutes but those are followed by nearly 10 minutes of meandering nothingness. maybe i just do not get it but it is in no way enjoyable for me to listen to 10 minutes of near silence. the closer is pretty good. nothing amazing though. solid melody but it does not live up to the opener or epitaph. overall in the court of the crimson king is a solid album in king crimsons canon but it is far from their best in my opinion and i happen to find it a tad bit overrated. just my opinion though.,0
in the court of the crimson king 1969 by king crimson is a dark portrayal of the you.s. vietnam war from the perspective of the delta force. it is unashamedly darkadmittedly repressive but so is most rock and roll. after all do you really want the governmentor many others but that is a matter of speculationreading your rocknroll novels? king crimson is so stark in its realism that the viet cong might as well have had their own bandrocknroll without lyrics. the impact of this novel on the vietnam war years is both profound and surprising even by todays standards. in conclusion i came to the conclusion that luo hua city mistress was indeed different from his wife.,0
clearly influential and in many ways ahead of its time. i try to rate music with the era in mind though admittedly i listen to nearly nothing from the 60s and little from the 70s so my ability to compare and contrast is limited. what is clear though is on a 42 minute album that there is a good 8-9 minutes of pointless meandering improv wankery going on during moonchilds the dreamthe illusion sections. this renders about 20 of this album pointless if not irritating and a big mark against it. perhaps this is forgivable again given this came out in the late 60s. i am also not sold on track 2 i talk to the wind. it is okay but a bit too hippy-dippy without a meaningful build up crescendo or let down. i do not suspect this track was much different than much of the other rock music of the era. tracks 1 3 and 5 are clear winners though even forgiving the frustrating amount of repetition in title track the court of the crimson king. despite that numerically it is hard to justify giving a 4 for an album with 20 filler that is actively irritating. i am surprised that i actually liked this as much as i did however so a solid 3.5 will do.,0
i am astonished at the popularity of this album it feels very overrated to me and i cannot believe it is rated above so many classic albums on rym. also unlike some prog masterpieces it sounds so dated. i have never got the pure adulation for 21st century schizoid man including mirrors no less!. the song is decent enough with a strident urgent tempo but hardly earth shattering. moonchild is the sort of song that gives progressive rock a bad name. even if i grew a beard and downed 5 pints of real ale i still could not appreciate it. unfortunately that is over a 14 of the album wasted on one song! the title track is far more succesfull good use of mellotron and lakes vocals fit the mood well. but it does not seem to warrant it is near 9 minute length. the one thing i talkto the wind can say is its better than moonchild. it is ok if a tad dull. epitaph including ..actually just no..is the most successful song on the album where lake puts in a sterling vocal performance. very good. not a massive crimson fan but on the rare occasion i pull out one of their cds it is usually red not this. overrated in my opinion but it least it has a memorable album cover.,0
re-listened to this for its 50th anniversary. i cannot believe they would put some limp-dick bullshit like i talk to the wind after 21st century goddamn schizoid man. epitaph and the court of the crimson king are both prog-rock mellotron classics. moonchild sounds like a first-year contemporary improv class trust me i have done it.,0
this is where an entire genre essentially began that is a criticism not praise. robert christgau while brilliant is far from right about everything. he remains certainly right about in the court.,0
i would not say this is like the all-time best prog rock i came in 5 minutes click to play album of all time. i am personlly more favourable to that of close to the edge but i can respect this. 21st century schizoid man is one of the greatest song ever made even with the blatant stealing from kanye west  epitaph and court of the crimson king are also prog rock epics are are worth noting. moonchild is uh...yeah i do not like it. the first few minutes sound really cool but then it just sounds like they accidentally recorded the bands sound check and just kept it in the song. i are not sitting through 9 minuted of that lol but yeah good album. just some shortcomings and it is not even the best king crimson album,0
1 yes please! pow! prog rock that rocks? i will have three please. 2 enough twee to knit a cardigan no thanks i will use one of my three 21st century schizoids that i previously purchased instead of this snooze-fest. 3 mmm i am ready for lunch and it is a full-bodied and heartily good dish with a little bit of wool in it but it adds to the flavour. 4 i could not review this track because my record player started malfunctioning a couple of minutes into it and it sounded like a man failing to carry a lot of instruments at once up some stairs. i will just have a 21st century schizoid snack instead i am glad i bought all three of them. 5 all outta snacks going to have to settle on this for supper. it will do i am not exactly going to starve and i set myself up with a hearty breakfast and wholesome lunch.,0
21st century schizoid man is a real roller-coaster that i have never been fully able to make my mind up on. sometimes it is a blast of avant garde jazz and sometimes well sometimes well it is plain shite jazz. like a bunch of kids hammering the dj button in a music lesson except not as funny. do like the john lennon style vocals. truthfully though i think kanye did this track better. i talk to the wind is a pleasant little track. it does little to impress me though. its a reasonably nice thing. sounds a bit like that really shit song from a porno. not even like the fun porn groove sound but you know the boring bits when they drift off and give some really dull plot bit. yes you heard it from me king crimson sounds like the shit bit of a porno. not even the fun stocklibrary funky stuff when they get down and dirty. the boring stuff. epitah comes bodly in like it is ennio morricone and has some david bowie like vocals going on. this one fucking goes for it you know. i am a fan. moonchild has decent atmosphere but cannot quite match epitah. i cannot help but think the tracks are not as interesting as they seem to think to warrant the length of them. like i get to build such an atmosphere needs time but it is not good enough to hold me for it. that is why these tracks which do start off quite nicely can really bore me my the end and just annoy me. what a snoozer of a track. finally things pick up again with the court of the crimson king. some fucking flutes and shit come in. vocals are pretty cool. solid closer. this and epitah i can get behind. these are alright. had the album been a but shorter and had less of the silly stuff i could see myself saying yes it is really good. i am still trying to figure out the full appeal of this album. comes in with some crazy nonsense that is not terrible but really falters against something like what miles davis would have been putting out around the same time. in a silent way wipes the floor with this shit. afterwards the album goes in a slower direction that is completely different. all i can think of is if i wanted this kind of sound i would go to ashra or brian eno. fripps later work is definitely better than this. you can definitely see though some of what made him so excellent later on in this though in all fairness. perhaps this just gets credit for coming out so early and being influential. is that the obsession with it? if that is the case then respect where its due but it does not do a lot for me. in the past i have been very resentful to this kind of music. at this point i do not think it is terrible i just think there is stuff that does the same and sounds better.,0
21st century schizoid man is a masterpiece. first time i heard it i was absolutely blown away. i talk to the wind sounds more grandiose than it should and fairly boring. epitaph suffers from the same thing but it is marginally less boring. moonchild is pretty good if you are about to sleep. the last track is supposed to be the best one on here but i guess i will grant it the silver medal losing to the opener. it seems like a rock opera of sorts. i will give it a weak 810.,0
the thing i do not hear many people talk about in respect to crimson king - and i feel like that is weird because of how transparent it is - is that the music sounds awful. not awful in the sense that it is bad music but more in the sense that this might be one of the worst production jobs in any album that has ever been canonized. the mixing very often just plain sucks being the worst offender greg lakes voice being always really fucking low in the mix what many listeners have awkwardly assumed was an intentional artistic decision with deep implications related to the albums supposedly innovative qualities and let us be honest this is not that innovative despite a few fresh ideas here and there. mcdonald spent hours and hours overdubbing mellotron and wind layers in order to get an ok-ish job at developing enveloping atmospheres probably ignoring that reed and the velvets had already achieved such thing with better results two years ago with sunday morning. the organ on epitaph sounds scratchy as fuck and it always turns me off when trying to give the album a listen. this is not a cheap singersongwriter album this is a prog-rock epic. imagine if selling england by the pound sounded as shitty as this nobody would be giving a cent away for it. wikipedia tells me the stereo master recorder used during the mixdown stage of the album had incorrectly aligned recording heads and that such misalignment resulted in a loss of high frequencies and introduced some unwanted distortion. yeah that might have a bit to do with it... but it cannot be all. cmon. sounds like a crappy excuse more than anything. and i do not think every single copy has the same problem. if it sounds shitty it is because it sounds shitty so let us discuss that. do you guys know fragile came out only two years later? and foxtrot just three? those sound much better. besides let us not pretend there is not some of the most annoying fantastic poetry ever on the album. torinn has already covered this peter sinfield often gets so devoted to the development of his lyrical theme that he forgot people were actually going to hear it being sung. i cannot blame him he had no reason in 1969 to think this band would have any listeners. the first section of moonchild is i think particularly problematic. but all the songs at some point or another get a bit too drowned in their own self-indulgences. if i could go back in time and cancel somehow the release of this album i would do it in order to stop the legion of idiots that would come after. not like i would have destroyed music or anything i am pretty sure 70s kids would have found some other way to suffice their need for classical-pop crossovers. this is just some more stuff that adds to the big list of pretentious andor annoying things about this record. fortunately good songs -or at least interesting ones- can make up for things like shitty sound and there is some of that stuff in here. 21st century schizoid man which is probably the most emblematic track of the album is a furious piece of jazz-rock and listening to it feels like walking barefoot through a path of burning ashes. the song does seem to go on for a bit longer than it should but most of the band plays throughout it without getting any exhausted. and it is a lot of fun there is a jam of chaotic brass playing noisy guitar solos and it is all sandwiched in between the apocalyptic classic set of verses that greg lake sings sings? with a megaphonic voice that resembles that of a radio host announcing that the end is near. and there is michael giles always playing like a badass and not missing a single note. i appreciate all those things very much. if every song was like this the status of this record would be perfectly understandable. but then the rest of the album happens. i talk to the wind is just a plain boring composition. with boring flutes there are even two flute solos but i never remember any of them are there with the inane vocal performances of lake and mcdonald and some nonsensical lyrics that probably helped settle the aforementioned standard for overly self-important lyrics in progressive rock. it is six minutes long and not much happens. figure it out for yourself. and in epitaph things do not get much better lake manages to make the thing sound a bit more convincingly epic but the song itself is still a very basic piece of atmospheric rock that goes on forever and never quite displays the melodic greatness that it should be developing given the important classical influence. besides it sounds like shit. there is some good stuff that i like the organ crescendo at the 345 minute mark the always-present low notes on the piano that help build a very eerie atmosphere and last climax of the song with that bizarre instrument that comes in during the seventh minute. i actually like moonchild a bit even though it often gets dismissed as the weakest track. it seems to be only one moment on the record where the band just compromises to the silly search of instrumental color instead of creating dated and pompous soundscapes. the way the song comes to an end with the gentle melody of the vibraphone is very sweet and that is something you would not expect to hear on an album like this. the title track is epitaph all over again only that a bit more dynamic - in particular i like the drumming here - and with a long false ending. on one hand the song was already long enough but on the other hand the reprise gives room for some pretty counterpoints and the display of some impeccable guitar noise so it really does not really fuck the song up. quite the opposite actually. i do not like the way the album ends though. they just stop the recording in the middle of chaos. laaaaazy. so yeah flawed flawed flawed songs. still i have to give props to this record because even though it does not always hit right on the mark it always every fucking time manages to sound iconic. this is music that sets an image that can be remembered. maybe it is how grandiose the music tries to be maybe it is the uncomprehensible pretentiousness of the band but you always know what the songs are doing and what is that you will remember about them. there is a reason why kanye sampled 21st century schizoid man of all things that moment when lake sings screams? the title words tower themselves above anything else like giving the clear impression that you are in front of the only thing standing gloriously in the post-apocalyptic 21st century world that we did not exactly get although with all the cold war paranoia the imagery seems justified. lake lamenting the words confusion will be my epitaph  as i crawl a cracked and broken path in the last set of choruses of epitaph sounds like one of the most self-assured things anyone has ever sung and it makes you wonder why anyone would sing those words. the songs do not die in their weaker moments but try to resurrect and reaffirm themselves as important fragments of folk tales that will have to be confronted and understood - to put some thought to it - even if there is really not much to understand. i look at the charts for 1969 and i find many greater albums though everything from 5 to 11 is better. i would not put this record on my top 10 for that year. would be lucky to enter the top 20. same for the prog-rock charts there are many many better progressive rock albums where to pick from. albums that sound better are way less corny and have actual songs that deserve to be remembered. in the court of the crimson king might be an interesting listen from time to time if only because of the musics iconic component which i have already discussed. but it is not a record as preciously atmospheric as the dark side of the moon or rock bottom nor as rewardingly tuneful as selling england by the pound or foxtrot nor as fierceful and forward-heading as thick as a brick red or fragile. if crimson king is the quintessential progressive rock album it is because of the particular place in time and space of its conception. which you know i can admire. but not in the form of a rave review. and not today of all days. is in the court of the crimson king the most overrated album of all times? well... i would probably say so if i were suddenly asked the question but i suspect that if i tried to put more effort into the search i would quickly find other more overrated albums. at least i can understand why people praise this one. and i actually think it is pretty justified getting a vinyl copy even if it is just to have the artwork around. i mean... it looks awesome and the screaming guy does make you feel anxious for a second. i would not have it in my bedroom watching me while i sleep though. 7.5,0
my overarching theory on king crimson is that they have managed to masterfully release near-identical records with just minor variations over the years and that is not even meant as a mockery or even a critique of them. sometimes the most interesting music is one which only differs slightly from another and in king crimsons case the differences are sometimes quite meta in that it feels their songs are rearranged before being put on wax. even internally the band has at least two occasions wherein they rehashed the same basic musical concept and applied it in a new way. this did not happen quite as overtly on this album as those that followed but it nonetheless is something to consider as well. now frankly this is also a bit of a reduction on what i mean to state about their music but really it seems they have something of a checklist with which to compose their works. that checklist is  two hard-rocking hitters one noticeably lighter than the other the court and schizoid man larks tongues parts 1 and 2 red and one more  the crooning song i talk to the wind exiles starless  a midway between the previous two epitaph book of saturday fallen angel  the prog song moonchild providence the talking drum granted i have not listened to the rest of the bands material in quite some time but the notion that this neatly applies to their three most celebrated works is telling to me be it that the bands most accessible when there is this spread specifically or if there is a shadow of some larger thematic decision. one need only look at my ratings to see that i am not altogether bothered by this and in fact i find it extremely interesting to question why there is such a variance in my personal reception of these albums. red undoubtedly rocks the hardest and larks tongues is almost definitely the most adventurous. this one? i think this album is most in line with what would become the typical progressive rock album and i cannot help but feel this is a major consideration upon the great number of folks that rate this so highly. its legacy is certainly enormous but the effect its had in tandem with the music presented is a bit less exciting than i would like it to be. i will be content to listen to larks tongues another dozen times before i come back to this one.,0
one of the pioneering examples of english prog pomposity and one of the most egregious offenders. the musicians are excellent the album cover a classic and the opening track is vicious and damned good but after that it becomes unbearably pretentious. greg lake would later make this seem like a masterpiece as 13 of the 70s bad taste machine elp robert fripp would make better king crimson records and would do his best work adding his puzzling dazzling guitar to records by other artists. ian mcdonald would be a founding member of fucking foreigner of all things. the drummer later played for leo sayer not kidding. a strung-out jimmy page ascending a mountain top dressed as a sort of wizard druid in the song remains the same was subtle and earthy compared to this long-winded nonsense. how on earth it is so highly rated on here is anybodys guess. must be a strong contingent of medieval knights with accounts.,0
i love rym to death but the overall charts are undeniably dominated by the vestiges of dad rock - that distinct genre of 70s guitar heroism instantly recognizable by its middling tempos grandiloquent solos badass moustaches and impresive sideburns. now king crimson is far from the worst offender of this era. in fact the opening track here is genuinely exciting and worth every second of its 7 minute runtime. the title track is majestic in the best sense of the word and i suppose i talk to the wind is good for lighting a candle and staring into the distance if you are into that sort of thing. problem is this leaves us with barely 20 minutes of good music. because the other 45 of this supposedly genius album is - frankly - throwaway garbage. i cannot imagine how anybody could objectively listen to moonchild and take it seriously let alone consider it as part of a masterpiece. are we thinking independently here or just following the cult? overall the emperor has some clothes but misses a few vital garments. this lp is a mixed bag only half worthy of the fawning it routinely receives.,0
i am a huge fan of progressive rock and i think this album is greatly overrated. while the compositions are often inventive and the band was far ahead of its time much of the album is bland and boring. it is very vocal-heavy. it seems to be more influenced by soul than by jazz which is great if that is your cup of tea. i appreciate these guys for what they contributed and for making very listenable music but i have heard much better progressive rock. that said this is one of those albums that every rock fan should familiarize themselves with if not because it is a solid rock album then at least because it is so highly acclaimed by music critics in general and so influential on subsequent rock bands.,0
ok... this is the best king crimson album. naturally some may think i am saying something self-evident but i was not at all sure because there are many highly appreciated albums or songs within the catalogue of king crimson which i do not like at all. originally in the court of the crimson king was the first crimso album that i heard but it was on the background in my friends flat about 15 years ago and i may have been slightly drunk. so when i started exploring the crimso albums 196974 i decided that i would listen to other albums first and end up my exploration at the court of this crimson king. i guessed it was going to be more interesting that way the original magnum opus did not have a massive effect on my further listening experiences. i started from larks tongues in aspic which i did not like much. i also considered the amazingly appreciated red even substandard. up to this my favourite crimso album was lizard. but anyway in the court... sounds better. i am not at all fond of the disharmonic features that are present on all at least 196974 king crimson albums. here those are virtually dumped into one song 21st century schizoid man and even that one is not bad though honestly speaking i cannot say that i like it. moonchild is massively overlengthy but it is somehow intelligible this obviously is the way it was meant to be while in most similar cases in the crimso catalogue that may not feel very obvious through listening  you just believe that mr. fripp certainly wanted it that way. i talk to the wind epitaph and and the court of the crimson king are honestly good numbers. thus coming to know this album still did not make me a king crimson fan not even close and while i remembered some beautiful fragments from my earlier first listen i similarly recalled some uglier ones so i may be positively surprised especially while i have always hated the album cover. in the court of the crimson king is ok.,0
uhmmm... there is only one song that is worth your time and that is the 3rd track on this 5-song lp epitaph. this album opens up with a horrible pathetic attempt at black sabbaths metal rock. the lead singer seems to think that the voice distortion sounds pretty cool when in fact i cannot make out a single word he is saying. but worst of all is this drumguitar solo that just screams pretentious. next we have ourselves a 6 minute tune that is calming and oozing. i like the flutes on it. i think it would have been better if it were cut a little shorter in my opinion. third track is the standout track. this song is definitely worthy of being on red the bands best record. i really love this song. fourth track is pretentious garbage. quite possibly the epitome of boring. fifth track is yet another overrated pretentious song. honestly i think the chord progression and the chorus are amazing but the length of this track and all the babbling about middle age mystic-epic-wizardy make this song laughable. they could have broken the mold a little by stepping in a guitar solo or something just saying. they could have done something to make this a little less repetitive and more interesting. so there it is in the court of the crimson king rating d,0
more than enoughs already been written about the original album so i will just comment on the bonus features in this edition. aside from the wonders of hearing a 2009 mix of this classic album in surround audio some of the bonus tracks are superb additions. in particular the alternate album which is all-instrumental and in some cases quite stripped-down studio out-takes. my favourite thing is the power-trio instrumental version of 21st century schizoid man i.e. played in the 1969 studio solely by fripp giles and lake. at the moment i am liking it better than the main version! especially hearing michael giles fantastic drums move to the foreground with extra reverb and really thundering from 5 speakers  and his kick drum is incredibly fast and powerful. many of the guitar and bass elements that are rather buried in the main version are revealed with astonishing clarity in this plainer take. it is good to finally hear precisely what is going on in this normally very dense piece. fuzzed vocals? shrill saxes? if you have heard them a thousand times over 40 years they are not missed here at all. there are numerous takes of i talk to the wind some only instrumental others with different solos. each version is excellent and worth hearing it must have been very hard to choose only one for the original album. i found it very cool to hear instruments like piano acoustic guitar and clarinet moved to the forefront on epitaph and itcotck  not to mention the mellotron overdubs being separated out to distinguish each one  though truth be told this causes the pieces to sound even more moody blues than the main versions do. still enjoyable especially the starring role giles fancy kick-drumming commands in the latter. oh and it is nice to hear a very abridged version of the normally tedious moonchild it made me somewhat appreciate the song for the first time. while i still vehemently disagree with the legions who feel that itcotck is king crimsons best or most important album at least this edition has me raise its rating by half a star.,0
decent but highly overated. 21st century schizoid man isnt bad and the court of the crimson king is good but stuff inbetween is mostly mediocre.,0
i really enjoyed this. i do not know much about progressive rock or this time period at all but i can say that there were parts of this album that really spoke to me. i loved the beginning of moonchild i loved all of the opening track and i really liked i talk to the wind. i am not sure how i felt about tracks three and five but i will definitely be giving this more listens and i fully expect my rating to increase.,0
lt1 although the album allegedly has five tracks it could just as easily have been divided into seven. that means two tracks would have been cut into two those being 21st century schizoid man the instrumental and the verses at the beginning are pretty much entirely mutually exclusive although the main riff from the instrumental capitalizes well on the main riff of the verse admittedly and moonchild which could be cut into the song per se and the pointless directionless uninspired and altogether unnecessary improv section that follows it. and now we are left with two templates with the instrumental and the improv section on one side representing the more experimental side the album boasts and the remaining five tracks on the other which makes up the bulk of the release. if we eliminate the former side the remainder becomes entirely transparent and altogether unimpressive. essentially in the court of the crimson king is a pop album with unnecessarily long tracks talking about politics and fantasy shit. influential and historically relevant as it may be the album is just a bit dishonest really. the intimidating track lengths are not obtained by progressing the songs in some meaningful way towards magnificent conclusions or important segues no what king crimson actually do is to just repeat the same old verse and chorus dance interspersing some little interludes usually solos in between so as to break the monotony a bit until they reach whatever their understanding of the song being done is. that is literally all they do on i talk to the wind on moonchild and on in the court of the crimson king with varying success. on the non-instrumental parts of the other two tracks they manage to do even less than that. and no matter the song we are talking about the riffs and melodies of the songs their actual themes just do not hold the weight of the length they are supposed to carry. it is hard to imagine melodies that could accomplish such a task for a whole albums length. the only one that pulls through in the end relatively unharmed is i talk to the wind but that one gets to use the opener for second-hand momentum for a while as once that fizzles out the problem is just as apparent as in the tracks that follow. nevertheless with the tune it has it could have easily been an absolute classic were it not for how little reason it has for extending for the length it does. now one good thing does come from this insistence on length it allows king crimson to do some neat work on the atmospheres of the songs and they do a considerable bit of that on epitaph but all in all it just is not enough. at the end of the day in the court of the crimson king consists entirely of half baked song ideas extended way beyond what is reasonable with a few jabs at the jazz scene plus i talk to the wind. once the novelty fades away there is not much left.,0
if you claim to be a progressive rock fan as i do you have to give this album its due amount of respect. 21st century schizoid man is the perfect blend of aggression and control while the rest of the album demonstrates that there was a reason that these guys were considered the first masters of prog. the most valuable part of this album is that if it did not exist then neither would many of my favorite bands. for that i do tip my hat.,0
talk about an epic opening track. the first time the riff kicks in -- with fripp on guitar and mcdonald on saxaphone - is breathtaking every time. nothing else on the album matches it but the slow burn on epitaph comes close. the first third of moonchild is good but the improv meanders too long. the quieter moments as a whole can stand up to the more obviously impressive ones thanks to innovative arrangements on the mellotron but there are a few things that keep me from rating it higher. why does the improv on moonchild need to go on for 9 minutes instead of 6 or even 3? why is the coda on the closing track even there? nevertheless i cannot imagine what it would have been like to hear this way back when it was released. even if you do not like prog rock -- like i generally do not -- it is worthy of several listens.,0
this is one the most influential albums of the so-called dad rock genre. too bad it did not age that well - of course it must have been a shock to hear this album in 1969 but let us be honest the mellotron and choirs sound really cheesy at times. the album itself starts with 21st century schizoid man which is the highlight of the whole recording and probably the reason we still talk about this album after over 40 years. it is just ridiculously unique and ahead of its time. then the album gets pretentious and well boring. i talk to the wind is fine. epitaph is kind of overdramatic. moonchild lingers for way too long. and then it ends with the court of the crimson king which is pretentous too but at least it a really good song. forgot to mention it has its iconic gorgeous cover art.,0
moonchild is actually my favourite song. i guess i just have not given the album enough listens.,0
definitiv pionier des prog rock eine mischung aus schnellem frickeligem jazz-rock und leicht psychedelischem pop mit geigen und flten. alles gar nicht mal so schlecht aber mein ding ist diese art von musik nicht das ist mir alles viel zu nett und eingngig und berechenbar zu melodisch und melancholisch -- gar nicht so weit vom pop-mainstream entfernt wie man glaubt! als junger kerl htte ich das sicher groartig gefunden so wie marillion etwa heute gibt mir diese musik nicht viel. trotz einiger netten ideen fehlt hier letztendlich die substanz das ganze wirkt auf micht immer auch ein bisschen posig. das cover ist definitiv wesentlich dsterer und beeindruckender als die musik.,0
i like it but not up there with others on it. it is a classic but last few times have not really killed me.,0
je moet er voor zijn voor die typische jaren 70 progressive rock of art rock. niet alle groepen uit die periode zijn nog steeds even boeiend om te beluisteren. king crimson is gelukkig wel nog een groep die nog steeds relevant is. in the court of the crimson king is hun debuut en nog steeds hun beste album. het album biedt een donkerder kant van wat we gewoon waren van de muziek eind jaren 60. muzikanten mochten hun muzikale veelzijdigheid en intelligentie meer en meer gebruiken om moeilijker structuren toe te passen op hun muziek. het contrast tussen stille en luidere passages wordt onderzocht en is al een beetje de voorloper van de hele alternatieve scne van twintig jaar later. ook bombastische momenten worden niet geschuwd iets wat later groepen als pink floyd volledig zouden perfectioneren. de groep neemt rustig zijn tijd om de ideen volledig uit te werken in hun lange songs varirend van 6 tot 12 minuten. meer dan veertig jaar na datum is dit album nog steeds even verrijkend en verscheiden als toen het werd uitgebracht hoewel het toen helemaal geen commercieel succes was. zelfs kanye west gebruikt tegenwoordig samples uit dit album.,0
beh  fico. non posso metterlo in dubbio. pure io ascoltandolo in un primo momento mi galvanizzo.. e il progressive non mi  mai dispiaciuto. dopo un po per..... emicrania assurda.,0
some really great stuff here as well as some really great musicianship. but it is the definition of overlong.,0
21st century schizoid man i love chaos and this song has a strong dose of chaos in a fairly original prog-rock format. lyrics are unintelligible apart from the title of the track. i talk to the wind absolutely nothing wrong with this song. all the jazz sensibility in the flute or mellotron? and keyboard parts may be lost on me and the dreary vocals do not do much for me but the song is pleasant. epitaph has a false sense of grandiosity which unnerves me. uninteresting. moonchild two minutes of substance. i cannot thing of a more unamusing way to spend 12 minutes than listening intently to this song. and given that some of the sounds in outro are annoying or startling they outweigh anything positive in the first two minutes. the court of the crimson king comparable in quality to the opening number but its slower speed loses most of the chaos. the flutey solo halfway through is actually fairly enjoyable i must confess. lyrics are among the best on the album some albums just give me the burning desire to knock them down a peg. but to review them i have to listen to every song and give it a fair chance again which sometimes leads to me having a better appreciation for the album even if i still do not love it. this is not the case with itcotck. however influential it may be it is simply not enjoyable to listen to.,0
sorry but this really is not my kind of music. everything is nice and beautiful and harmonic there is flutes and violins all over the place. there were a few nice parts but in the end i do not see much difference to mainstream pop music except that the songs are twice as long as they should be so that it can be called progressive and art and thus is hip enough for hip people. i give half a star for the cover which is the only memorable thing about this album.,0

in the time it took me to eventually summon the motivation to write a review for this i initially thought my rating would be higher than the one i have decided to give. after getting a better idea of the album content however i now feel 3.5 is justified. 21st...man is a unique fiery jazz prog work and i think it is brilliant. love the tempo change midway with greg lakes walking bass and the jazz band inclusion works really really well. i talk to the wind is not terrible but i mainly enjoy it for the repeated suspension at the end of each verse phrase bit of music nerdery i am slightly ashamed to say. epitaph is fantastically haunting and i love the bass instruments bass clarinet? about midway through with their really brooding drones that have on a couple of occasions given me chills. now i will explain the main reason this album lost my appreciation somewhat fucking moonchild. it starts off like all of the other songs with promise of something exciting and unexpected. the excitement however never comes and it disappears after barely two and half minutes note the length of the actual song!. when i notice how long there is left of the song to go i am thinking wow there is so much left of the song what interesting ideas are going to come in to fruition. little did i realise that i was going to hear tiresome uninteresting somewhat pretentious experimental wank interspersed with sweet fuck all. now if it had been one of those songs that is long for the sake of being long with just silence and is leaving a little present at the end as a reward for your patience - one example is  dead girl off of acid baths paegan terrorism tactics - then i am familiar with the concept and can just fast forward to a couple of minutes before the end when something starts happening albeit weird shite when referring to dead girl admittedly. king crimson however unintentionally or not provoke the listener in to think something is going to happen in the next 9 minutes by having something playing in it constantly whether that be an organ or random flute or drum spells implying that perhaps there will be a build up leading to a climax. fans of the album would say the title track is the much expected climax but for fuck sake. did it have to be 9 minutes of utter tripe that adds nothing to the listeners experience whatsoever? a theory i had was that they did that as a way of making the song more progressive and going with a sort of post modern theme. in my opinion it was an experiment that failed quite stupendously. the title track is an interesting tale that let us your imagination concoct interesting mental images of what the hell is actually going on. i do like the song as a whole but am quite happy when it finishes with a satisfying tonic major chord at around 640. then again even the somewhat cheeky repetition of the main fragment following that is a nice touch. instead however there is a drum fill with a few more reiterations of the chorus this time in a different key before building to a discordant mess that just cuts off at the end. disappointing end to a rather good album i feel. just a few words before i finish this for those who have not heard the album before i suggest if you decide to stick with listening to moonchild try your best to stay patient and you might be best just skipping to the title track after two and a half minutes. good effort to do something original and creative crimson but was not without its flaws. thanks though.,0
great album that just does not move me anymore like it used to do once in the past.,0
i see this as a missed opportunity for me. i listened to 20th century.... to gauge whether i would like the album and hated it. 3 years later listened to more of it and loved it and the rest of most of kc back catalogue. still hate 20th century.... still cannot stand the jazz stuff but love the other stuff,0
talvez de lo primero q haya escuchado de ellos hace ya un tiempo despues de leer que era el mejor lo cual nunca me parecio. si bien me quedo con lo mas chiflado de ellos red por ejemplo y esto sea muy diferente es uno de esos discos q crecen mucho en uno con los aos.,0
ya know the long ending of moonchild might actually be my favorite part of the album. so nocturnal mystic and dreamy. i also love the freakout parts in 21st century schizoid man obviously.,0
this album is mesmerizing. quite possibly the greatest early prog-rock album ever. every track is great. the only downfall is the bare instrument improv at the end of moonchild.,0
la cara a me sigue pareciendo excelsadesde la brutalidad metalica del comienzopasando por la delicadeza de i talk to the windmi favoritao la grandeza de epitaph.musica panoramica del maximo nivel. mi problema estriba en la cara b.moonchild siempre me ha resultado largaespesaderivativa...y el tema final redunda en la grandiosidad de epitaph pero no le llega a la suela del zapato.aqui la voz de lake me resulta pomposa y cargante al mismo tiempo.una segunda mitad grandilocuente y bastante hinchada. aprobado suficientepero podia haber sido mejormucho mejor.,0
gli anni 60 sono un covo di falsi miti che il tempo ha contribuito a cementare. il debutto dei king crimson ha tutta laria dessere uno di questi. la loro colonna sonora da operetta televisiva suona quasi imbarazzante di fronte ai picchi conquistati dal progressive rock. la furia creativa che altri artisti seppero manifestare mette in ridicolo questo modesto album che non pu nemmeno vantare unoriginalit fuori dal comune. i king crimson avrebbero potuto impressionare il loro pubblico giusto per la pretesa di trasformare il format rock in unorchestra moderna in cui la musica accompagna unipotetica scena. nella fattispecie la scena  assente viene sottintesa. ma questo tentativo suona estremamente vacuo e superficiale. c pochissimo dellepocale tentativo di sintesi stilistica che invece caratterizz il genere negli anni a venire. anzi le contaminazioni jazz sembrano uno scimmiottamento da show domenicale. in questo album sopravvive unicamente un blando tentativo di scrivere una magniloquente favoletta medievale. lopening  la parte pi interessante. la chitarra ed il sassofono salternano ad una voce estremamente distorta costruendo un motivetto immediato ed appariscente. il vortice strumentale che copre la pi ampia parte della canzone ammicca concretamente al jazz e ricorda i successivi soft machine di third. se lintero album avesse seguito le orme di 21st century schizoid man in the court sarebbe stato un lavoro impeccabile ma subito dopo i 7 minuti dapertura le attese vengono miserabilmente tradite da un sonnolento idillo bucolico. i talk to the wind suona effettivamente come una ballata annacquata che non riesce a proporre davvero nulla di interessante. la voce annoiata nuota nelle torride linee del flauto. lassolo finale insegue il free jazz ma con carenti risultati. pare un clich andato a male. epitaph forse presagendo le difficolt del pezzo precedente propone immediatamente di voltare pagina con un attacco estremamente enfatico. qua i king crimson recuperano la loro caratteristica pomposit. il progredire lento e tragico della voce guidato dal mellotron conduce lentamente ad un assolo ristagnante e remoto che sembra preludere ai pink floyd dei concept esistenziali ma con un tocco teatrale in pi. la canzone altro non fosse pu vantare una composizione impeccabile con una serie di pause e riprese curate magistralmente per favorire il pathos ma i difetti sono gli stessi dellintero album. moonchild  il brano pi lungo con 12 minuti di registrazione. la prima parte  una narrazione dai toni fantasiosi accompagnata dallarpeggio di fripp e dalle percussioni mirando a suggestionare lascoltatore con queste tinte fosche e vagamente malinconiche. ma ancora prima di attecchire la canzone sprofonda in una stasi vibrante che tenta di rafforzare latmosfera notturna da noir psicotico. da qui in poi si articola una sessione improvvisata. in realt la canzone di per s era limitata alla povera ballata che riempie i primi minuti ma si decise di allungarla con questa tenue jam che d un tono astratto ed onirico al brano. la struttura non  lineare e passa per momenti di incomprensibilit caotica a semplici sessioni minimaliste conservando per il tono povero ed inconcludente del resto della canzone. in chiusura la mini-suite che dona il titolo al disco ripropone la faccia pi nota dellalbum quella della teatralit kitsch con un duetto di grandiosi voli di fantasia e romantici stralci di narrazione iperbolica. nulla di fondamentale per la nostra sopravvivenza.,0
i think this would probably be my favorite prog rock record if it only had 3 songs on it those being of course 21st century shizoid man epitah and in the court of the crimson king. the first song is a pretty psychadelic piece with lots of strange things in it but great none the less. epitah is one of the most epic ballads that i know of simply great lyrics and mind blowing music. the court of the crimson king is a pretty epic song on its own right as well with a great build up and amazing hook. the rest 2 songs though are pretty much the reason why i tend to dislike so much prog. they all sound far too pretencious and redundant boring rock and if i looked up the album looking for boirng pretencious prog rock i had enough already with jethro tull. overal though pretty great listen.,0
i like prog as much as anyone and i find this album good but extremely overrated. every song is at least twice as long as it needs to be with moonchild six times as long as it needs to be. so many groups did the same kind of thing much better including later incarnations of kc but this group did it first so they get all the love.,0
es un mal disco? dios me libre de afirmarlo de manera categrica. in the court of the crimson king irrumpe en mis odos de manera atronadora y luego se desinfla con el paso de los minutos interminables minutos de experimentacin y vanguardia. mi eterno conflicto con el rock progresivo slo se soluciona ocasionalmente cuando encuentro en sus ampulosas estructuras y pretenciosas aspiraciones reductos de emocin. pese a su incuestionable leyenda y legado todava no he vislumbrado en la msica de king crimson muelles a los que agarrarme. quiz algn da halle en ellos la chispa que me ayude a comprender tan magna reputacin pero creo que ese da an se encuentra lejos.,0
virgins late-1990s run of album-replica cd reissues of the king crimson catalogue are quite attractive. for example included along with the great-sounding re-master of their debut in the court of the crimson king was a small booklet full of old crimson-pertinent photos and news clippings from that heady time period of the very late 1960s. it can make for a rather fascinating read if you have a few minutes. the album might have the greatest opening track in rock music history! 21st century schizoid man has been performed and covered countless times but this original version is still essential and the stuff of progressive rock legend. i talk to the wind is simply beautiful and it makes one wonder what avenues king crimson might have explored had ian mcdonald had a bit more say in the bands direction. despite its deservedly exalted status for me personally this album is a bit dull and it just has not held its luster over the years. fortunately king crimson has!,0
the psych influences may be limited but this is a classic among prog albums and it is influence on the underground rock scene at the time cannot be overestimated. somber and morose flavored matl mixed with some mildly annoying avant-gard cuts. grades - 2 bs 1 b- and a c.,0
a whole lot of riffing and an awful lots of pointless fucking noodling. makes it hard for it to stick for me.,0
not as good as i expected. the famous schizoid man is a belter of a track followed by two very mellow very english tracks before the noodle fest read that as yawn fest moonchild. court ends the album with a superior feel and the track itself encapsulates the styles throughtout the preceding tracks. fans of the moody blues will find much to enjoy here. id probably loved this album moe when i went through my prog rocks phase in my younger years now i find it a little bit whimsical and yawnsome in periods. no doubt the musicianship is top dollar and i am sue the improvisational peices will appear to some but id say those on red were better and more focused.,0
at the time of it is release this album was a stark contrast to the boy-loves-girl 3 minute pop songs of the early beatles et al. much as the sex pistols would rail against the prog dinosaurs in the next decade this was part of a turning point. we nerdy college boys loved the artwork and the concepts and the whole mind-expansion of classical and mythological allusions. having said that - 30 odd years later it does not stand up and it now sounds dated and pretty dull.,0
i own a nice original heavytextured gatefold copy but annoyingly this canadian wea issue also has the band name  the atlantic logo printed right on the front. i wonder if this feature see photo appeared in any other countries? this album has been more than sufficiently reviewed so that i need not add another one. i will simply say that this is not at all crimsons best album nor was greg lake its best singer.,0
the mirrors section of schizoid is excellent no question. the mellotron use on this album is staggering. no other album uses it to such good effect. ian macdonald shows himself to be one of the best horn players in the scene. but the lyrics are largely drivel. greg lake is a much better bassist than singer. michael giles is an indifferent drummer. primogeniture in the prog world has led this album to be more highly rated than it quite deserves and the next three are also buoyed unnecessarily. the wettonbruford years are far superior.,0
the tedious noodling on moonchild somewhat wrecks an otherwise enjoyable prog experience.,0
often considered an inspiration for much of the progressive rock that blossomed in the early 70s king crimsons debut album embodies the serious though not necessarily humourless approach that grew from the most recent developments in jazz and rock namely fusion and psychedelia. in fact the opening number 21st century schizoid man including more importantly mirrors might have been the sort of thing miles davis and jimi hendrix would have cooked up had they collaborated together instead it was left up to a bunch of white kids from england. it is a stunning opener sporting a guitar riff bordering on heavy metal and a snarling distorted vocal it must have scared a few of the more sensitive long-hairs fresh from the beatles white album. within progressive rock its song within a song format soon became standard practice immediately alienating the true rockers as rock had alienated the rock n rollers before them. the inner section mirrors is the real revelation sounding unlike anything else with its tight unison playing between the guitar and drums like musical bursts on a machine gun not lost on yes. the way the next song - i talk to the wind - contrasts with the opener is also part of the emerging formula of progressive rock. its sweet harmonies delicate guitar jazzy flutes tinkling percussion and whimsical nostalgia are some of the ingredients that fed into the contemporaneous canterbury scene. above all though its the big mellotron wash that one identifies most with this album. it is there on the intro to epitaph a stark yet bombastic anthem that impresses sonically even if it is a bit simplistic musically the moody blues had their ears open to this one i suspect. greg lake delivers its morbid lyric operatic-like as straight as he can probably under strict instructions from mr. fripp not to laugh. it is hard to clearly identify the other pieces incorporated into this song but i will take their word for it. moonchild brings some welcome relief on cd at least and is another lilting lullabye similar to i talk to the wind. what follows though is controversial and troubles some listeners who otherwise greatly admire this album. the dream and the illusion who knows where one ends and the other begins are in fact beautiful little arrangements between guitar vibes and percussion. yes quite abstract and somewhat under-recorded but also highly imaginative and quite enchanting even funny if you can appreciate the subtle humour. they certainly add another layer of texture to an already fascinating album. anyway those who fell asleep are rudely awakened by the drum figure that ushers in the final epic and title track the court of the crimson king oh yes and its inner segments the return of the fire witch and dance of the puppets. the mellotron features large once again and the music as with epitaph relies on arrangements rather than composition. more eerie somber lyrics help to consolidate the medieval terror that qualifies this as a concept album. towards the end some of the mellotron goes out of tune - it always was a temperamental beast - but what it was capable of is admirably demonstrated here and subsequently found its way onto countless other albums of the genre and beyond. not bad for a debut.,0
this just seems like a highly pretentious and self-indulgent album...and i am usually a fan of pretension. 21st centurty schizoid man and moonchild are great songs. i talk to the wind and epitaph are well written but seem like songs that would prefer to hear performed by another band. the moody blues type vocals do not intrigue me at all. the ciourt of the crimson king is a horrible song. it reminds me of a renaissance fair and i do not enjoy renaissance fairs.,0
this is interesting and for some important. i think for shear presence of musicians and their intentions this is far better than a 1.5 star review. give me a break! then again i give things a .5 and folks love it!,0
60s music does not really enthrall me. well not in the way it seems to do with everyone else. i think it is down to production techniques but i am not sure. a solid album though.,0
i really like the opener but none of the other songs appeal me. maybe someday in another listen i will find why people praise this album so much.,0
some beutiful moments here are ruined by some very very boring moments. i really belive this album is good but i cannot give it higher rating because its too exhausting and tiring. the keepers here are i talk to the wind epitaph and the court of the crimson kingthe best song here,0
it is pretty good and all but sometimes i do not get the big deal about prog. whatever.,0
vastly overrated. i do not get it. this is my second kc record and i am sadly once again disappointed. being an avid pink floyd fan i hoped king crimson had that same prog beauty. unfortunately crimsons holy grail of album does not compare to the watersgilmore machine. in comparison court sounds more like ummagumma and atom heart mother - two of the floyd duds.,0
definitely an awesome album. nice and mellow with a great flow.,0
when the worst song on an album is also the longest it is never a good combination. disregarding the wankery on moonchild this is 44.5 star material. -- song-by-song - 3.9 album cohesiveness x2 - 3.9 overall - 3.9,0
i like the lizard album with it is jazzy noodling better than this one. i really really like epitaph and i think greg lake has the most beautiful singing voice. i do not really hate in the court of the crimson king it is just that the song has it is moments both musically and lyrically. i really do not like when the flute comes in on that tune and the chorus is kind of boring.,0
a great album but i do not understand all the hype surrounding this. how anyone can give an album with tracks like moonchild five stars is beyond me. sure this might be one of the first beginnings of progressive rock and so on but it does not have anything to do with the actual quality of the music. i mean 21st century schizoid man starts the album with a blast and is definitely the best track here but the rest of the material just does not equal its high standard. along with the total waste of 10 freakin minutes with moonchild the two minutes of the beginning are good by the way until it turns into a yawnfest the last track is also kind of a bore and way too long for its own good. oh the good side is that we get to hear lots and lots of mellotron here and there and epitaph is a beautiful song that would inspire many prog rock songs of the same styling. actually the songs themselves - if you do not count the schizoid man - are not all that complex or progressive in the true sense of the word they are more of psychedelic mood pieces. and i do not hear anything so mind-blowingly revolutionary here most of this mellow psychedelic stuff could have been made by i do not know the moody blues a year before the release of this album only the songs here are longer. what more can i say this is a nice first effort and they truly have a vision but if the material ranges from awesome to mediocre to dumb the result is that the album is not exactly excellent. sometimes i feel like it is only the schizoid man that keeps this ship from sinking into the sea of semi-good potential.,0
about as pretentious and overblown as prog rock can get. at least tracks 2 and 3 are decent. the rest of this album is laughable classic status be damned.,0
great calm spacey seventies music. the title track is amazing in it is simplicity and i talk to the wind is relaxing in it is quitness. it is just the songs could have been twice shorter but then it would not be called progrock i guess...good but not top 100 album with only 5 tracks!.,0
good and ambitious album creating very specific atmosphere. also the musicians are very skilled and tasteful at the same time. so why only 3.5? because in many cases king crimson did not know where to stop and a great song turned into some senseless noodlingmoonchild or just a snooze-festepitaph the title song. highlights 21st century schizoid man- so powerful and captivating i talk to the wind- this time mellow and captivating ,0
alright time for me to controversial again. 4.43 from my friends rankings? seriously? i understand the influential-ness of the whole thing but a lot of the artists this influenced are making me sick here in 2008. epitaph is a great song and 21st century schizoid man is decent too. but moonchild? really? this album is just over 42 minutes long and contains 5 tracks. 12 minutes 29 and 1 track 20 of this are moonchild. this creates a barrier to me giving this a good rating.,0
i enjoy most the other albums 1970-1984 better than this one.. it just sort of dies out on moonchild.. even i talk to the wind.. snore city.. hippy bla blas.. fripp takes it to better places in the years to come.,0
influential revolutionary and a classic. this one just does not impress me as much as others. first off all i do not get what the deal is with 21st century schizoid man. i just do not get it. it is mediocre song at best as far as i am concerned. moonchild is pointless. it goes nowhere. not only that it does not sound interesting in the least. ok the other songs are brilliant. 3 out of 5 songs just does not cut it for me no matter how great the other songs are. the court of the crimson king blows my mind every time i listen to it.,0
the first and last songs on this are pretty top notch but the middle 3 songs are very cheesy and difficult to listen to. i would have rated this a lot worse if the opening song was not so damn good. wish the rest of the album would have been similarly good.,0
i am a real prog rock fan and i was turned on to this band by a friend and i have got to say that it is not without it is charm. however i just cannot seem to get into it. prog rock is something that you should get lost in but this just has some good tunes in between really boring and cheesy moments,0
this ended up in my collection thanks to my boyfriend. i looked up what the three best kc albums were in terms of ownership and ratings bought them and then he never listened to them or at least he is never mentioned listening to them. i had played this one simply as it was thee first in terms of chronological order decided that my thoughts about late 60searly 70s prog rock had been right all the time and that this just was not for me. i have given it a few spins over the last couple of days so that i can try and do it justice as i am reviewing it for the go review game love it and i have to say things are not improving on repeated listens. i do not mind the beginning of moonchild i suppose but most of the album just sounds aged and cloying to me and bugger me it has the most awful cover - if i ever have yet another day to waste sitting at the pc rather than having a life out there in the real world and feel the need to do a my least favourite album covers list then this will be vying for the number one spot. as you can see i am already digressing from the music in this review and that is another problem. it just sounds kind of boring to me. five minutes into moonchild and all i can hear is the sort of plinkyplonky noise that my boyfriends 2 year old godson makes. i would much rather listen to drone at least that makes sense to me.,0
not the masterpiece that so many people hear in it. but that is personal. i love tracks 1 4 and 5. i heard this album when i was about 8. i was digging through dads collection and the cover struck me immediately. i played and flipped! so old and yet so loud and dark. 21st century schizoid man has not aged a bit but the 4 other tracks have not aged that well. it is still good but very 60s. schizoid could have been made last week. track 5 scared the shit out of me then and it still sends shivers down my spine.,0
gregs lakes vocals especially schizoid man are a real highlight on this album. the wonderful chaotic instrumental passages are a real blast and that iconic cover is one of the most memorable in rock. some parts tend to drag though hence 3.5 stars,0
5 stelle il primo brano 2 tutto il resto.,0
the noodling on moonchild gets old but it is not enough to bring down this album. a masterpiece.,0
moments of unnecessary pomposity and insincerity are covered up by some stunningly powerful explosions of greatness. just listen to the opening riff of 21st century schizoid man fucking epic.,0
i probably fessed up to this before but greg lakes vocals are to me like that little spoonful of sugar which helps the medicine of progressive rock go down smooth. so it has been with anything by elp and so it is with this king crimson debut. you have to wait out the first track before lake begins to sugarcoat anything but no worries 21st century schizoid man is a worthy hurricane of an opener. i have yet to finalize any kind of definitive list of tracks that blew my doors clean off the hinges but schizoid man is on the rough draft for sure. the real big moments come on epitaph a grandiose and of course! lengthy tale of woe in which lake matches the musical mood note for note. he grieves he worries he rages against the dying of the light. as he repeats the central phrase but i fear tomorrow i will be crying a wave of hopelessness washes over the world. the title track concludes the pageantry taking epitaphs air of grand despair for a nine minute stroll through the world of macabre. the dance of the puppets sounds exactly like i would have pictured it in my mind. if i ever pictured such things.,0
this ones clearly a landmark in the world of art rock or whatever you want to call it. parts of it have not worn especially well though some of the extended gentle passages hit modern ears as a bit twee some of the lyrics possess too much bug-eyed fairy-world wonder. still there is much that holds up and it is unquestionably important. 21st century schizoid man kicks plenty of ass to this day and in fact one wishes the boys had taken that aggressive approach more often. moonchild and i talk to the wind sure are pretty and epitaph has its moments. and hey that distinctive to say the least album art still rules.,0
album que dio forma definitiva al rock progresivo aqui no se me hace un gran disco completo pero por el hombre ezquizoide del s xxiepitafio y en la corte del rey carmesi resulta ser un muy buen disco 75100,0
honestly this album gets three stars alone just for the title trakk. brilliant brilliant song. unfortunately for king crimson one song cannot carry a whole album to the victory line. the songs got to work together as a team you see! 21st century schizoid man is a decent opener a distorted rock song with saxophone parts. the album then falls into a ditch that takes about 26 minutes to get out of. the three middle tracks are mostly just boring boring acoustic pieces not that there is anything wrong with acoustic pieces...my father was an acoustic piece! in the court of the crimson king closes with the song  not in the court of the violet queen which is 10 minutes of pure musical bliss that just steamrollz the rest of de album. but that is not very cooperative is it. if they could have just workkd together they cud hav won this dammiot damndit iu betg my housrn an my car and my wife onb yiouj baastard dbabfh i talk tob tyhe winf you wsuick and yiu too epitpah amnd inm noit forgettjing you moon child you are bringin sthe team down dam agh you ruiknd it for xda teame and that is what a review looks like from the point of view of a person who has no conception of how a review is supposed to be written thank you for joining me,0
ok i just bought this because of all the high ratings here. i do not get it? not very appealing for me. i will tuck it away for later review.,0
moments of prettiness that are ultimately consumed by the all-encompassing fluff of it all,0
robert fripp is a great guitarist and the drummer is pretty good here but i just do not get what the big deal is about this band.,0
21st century schizoid man moon child and i talk to the wind are amazing. the rest range from forgettable to horribly overblown.,0
thus far the only kc album i have heard but man does this ever have a feeling about it. disturbing peaceful hopeless epic in every sense of the word.,0
king crimsons debut effort in the court of the crimson king should get an award for the album cover which is very cool. beyond that the album is fairly up and down. the title track the court of the crimson king is nice but not great. 21st century schizoid man has some very unique and interesting vocal work but i talk to the wind is a mellow bordering on dull track. overall i can tell these are well written songs even if they are not my thing so to speak. a good album and for prog rock aficionados i can see why it is regarded so highly.,0
the greatest progressive rock album there is.,0
if i am honest i have only listened to this once. i found it to be half brilliant and half wanky rubbish hence the middling score.,0
not into it that much but 21st century schizoid man is brilliant and crimson king is pretty good too. i need to digest it more i guess.,0
great stuff mixed in with some real crap that everyone feels that they have to accept because otherwise this shit is brilliant. but listen let us not dress this album up because it has some real blemishes. now as an album this is not a 4 out of 5 it is fucking less than that just for i talk to the wind which wish washy tripe and a 6 min waste of vinyl. and let us not even mention moonchild. which is like listening to the moody blues gang rape donovan. which is also a problem for this album. it seems a little too much inspired by days of future passed. but i am sure when your really stoned and reading lotr for the umteenth time it hardly matters. love that fuckin opener though and the album cover... fuck yeah.,0
21st century schizoid man seems like a combination of early heavy metal and weird jazz fusion. after that comes the pretty folk song i talk to the wind. the rest of the album stays in this folk prog realm not counting the ending of moonchild which i refuse to recognize the existence of.,0
i guess i am just not a prog-rock fan because this album does little to nothing for me. it is all just too damn pretentious and over-blown for me to take. i mean i do not think that i could ever bring myself to trot this shambling mound out in front of any other self-respecting music fan without being completely embarassed. i guess if it was 1969 i was hearing this for the first time and was stoned out of my brain i might be more impressed and get it. today however it alternates between making me feel embarassed that i am listening to it and making me fall asleep. the musical virtuosity is obviously not in question. the emotion and impact is though. the only situation in which i find this music appropriate is perhaps a rainy sunday afternoon when you are sitting quietly reading the newpaper or a serious novel of some sort. even then i would rather turn some good jazz on or even classical.,0
i like 21st century schizoid man and i talk to the wind but the rest just seems overly done and very late 70s yes,0
i have had it with this album. i am moving on to their later material i cannot understand what is so damned interesting about it. i am dead certain the heavy amount of praise for this record is because of the year it was put out and the amount of non-jazz heads who have been inspired by it. the actual music is great throughout but beyond the first track i am at a loss for why i would come back and re-listen. i suppose the recurring synth lines of the last track are incredibly iconic epic and angsty but the song teases a little too much for my liking.,0
solid creative and very colorful this album indeed deserves its hype. 21st century schizoid man is some jazz-prog thing with that guitar theme which is often called the first stoner riff of rock music history. it is a tune you once heard and will stay with you for a lifetime. the other 4 tracks represent a different balladistic style though all of them are epic melancholic and kind of dark and romantic that i truly like - only the title track sounds too melodramatic to me. i talk to the wind is smooth and lounge still offering something sinister epitaph includes a fantastic symphonic orchestration and moonchild is a short lullaby with a 10 minute-long minimal improvisation-outro - and still i do not feel it pointless nor pretentious it totally has its place. so each song has an own character the production is rich and wonderful - if only the vocals were more in focus. the voices are pretty cool but it feels like they are a bit repressed. probably that is the only factor that keeps this album from being a favourite.,0
overrated. thoroughly groundbreaking but ultimately not very compelling.,0
i used to be a huge fan of progressive rock and i still enjoy a fair number of albums and bands grouped into the genre but i am not as keen on this album as some of my fellow fans are. this album has quite the reputation and on three tracks i think it lives up to it. epitaph and the court of the crimson king are great tracks and highly worth listening to and 21st century schizoid man is a prog masterpiece a definitive song of the movement that took my breath away when i first heard it and still amazes me to this day. definitely a song for the ages. unfortunately the other two songs really let the album down. i talk to the wind meanders with little to stimulate the ears but the album still could have made 4 or 4.5 stars if it were not for the tragedy that is moonchild. to call it simply boring would be an insult to all truly boring songs out there. it is so beyond boring and bland that i simply can only describe it as nothing. a complete waste of time. how king crimson could go from the excellence of 21st century schizoid man to the nothingness of moonchild is simply beyond me. despite this fact the album is still highly worth owning both for its place in history and the excellent material it does contain.,0
i bought a lot of highly recommended records such as this one in the 80s when people were getting rid of vinyl. some were great finds but this just does not work for me.,0
this is not a classic album in my book - moonchild is a complete waste of 12 minutes and has cost this album 1 point. unfortunately this trend would carry on until robert fripp teamed up with bill bruford and john wetton.,0
i like the title track but i am pretty bored by most of the rest of it although i have only listened to the full album twice so maybe after a few more listens...,0
there is a scene in the film buffalo 66 where christina riccis character tap dances in a bowling ally to king crimsons moonchild. it is a poignant scene in the film where vincent gallos character sees only her not the other distractions of the bowling ally and realizes the girl that he kidnapped is the girl for him. having been a fan of king crimson for nearly 20 years i did not recognize and had to look up the beautiful song when i re-watched the movie recently. out of the context of the album moonchild seemed completely foreign and that is kind of indicative of my opinion of in the court of the crimson king. moonchild begins as a pretty quiet pastoral ballad for about two minutes before shifting to a 10 minute improvisation which is not always entirely successful or interesting. there are four elements that i think make this album great though - elements 1  2 are the songs that bookend the beginning and end of the album. 21st century schizoid man is great heavy proto-metal while the title track that closes the album is grandiose. - element 3 the mellotron. what a cool instrument! it used short tape loops of strings flutes etc and was sort of the original sampler. i only really learned what a mellotron was in the past few years i thought there were string arrangements on the album for years. not a bad-ass keyboard. - element 4 that cover. that is absolute terror. how shocking this must have looked in 1969. legend has it the artist died only weeks after the album was released. like moonchild this album is not a total success. it has moments where it is great and moments when it is not so great. and there is a middle part that always makes me space out and forget what album i am playing.,0
i guess i have never been in the right mood or frame of mind for this album. yes i appreciate it but no i do not exactly salivate over it like other people. reputations aside in the court of the crimson king may have a kind of substance but for whatever reason it just washes right on through me. opener 21st century schizoid man has some great musical phrases that are wound around and around. but then comes i talk to the wind which is kind of just there just blah ballooned up and all fluffy and sweet with that flute like some prog rock serving of cotton candy and that is when i start to nod off. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... yes it may be nice but so what? the first few minutes of epitaph could use a few more herbs too all i am tasting from the pot there is a few bland boiled spuds barely seasoned with the salty dry drone of the vocalist and moving on up to around the four or five minute mark there is thankfully a few tidbits swimming around but it is otherwise keeping me hungry. moonchild is so spartan and so benign that while it probably has its niche as background music for falling asleep in being so subtle and random it almost becomes irrelevant. particularly when this goes on for twelve minutes. i do not know about all you but i have a life with other things to do rather than sit listless to this for so long. thankfully the court of the crimson king brings the album back to some semblance of listenability. so alright it is okay. i would not say it lives up to the hype though. yes yes maybe i just do not get it and i am fine with that.,0
i was told this was progressive type stuff. that it is. pretty bearable though. points off for that moonchild bland epic though. pretty decent the rest of it. you like this sort of thing a lot you are likely to give it 2 more stars.,0
yet another record i lost during a massive vinyl kidnapping. i think the thing i liked best about this album was the cover not only was it massively cool but it was fuzzy and fun to look at. okay so the music was quite decent although i am not a progressive music fan it still appealed in many ways. 21st century schizoid man was a really great tune in fact it seemed heavy in an entirely different way than i am used to but that is what made it neat. the music is rather epic it is got plenty of drive and the various instrumentation rarely seems overdone which is a rarity for this style of thing. this may only have five rather long songs on it but it is got a nice flow to it and every song included is at least decent. aside from the biggie in the court of the crimson king was my favorite but there is definitely plenty to like on here the sort of dark layer to everything makes it worthwhile. this may not be my kind of music but it is my kind of album one of the few in the genre that everyone should be able to like!,0
this album has great songs on it but they are too long -- even aside from moonchild two minutes of song ten minutes of tinkly noises. i say this as a big fan of prog rock including lots of long songs. this album actually sees about as much play from me now as red which was the first kc album i bought this was second -- that is to say not much. i liked both of them quite a good deal after getting them but they have sort of seeped into my brain to the point that actually listening to these albums does not really excite me anymore. fripp is quite tasteful here not that i mind most of his freakouts lakes pretty good whichever giles mike? it is who drums does so well and pete sinfeld is pete sinfeld. ian mcdonald was probably the true driving force here -- certainly his keyboards have a higher prominence than such things usually do especially on a king crimson album. it is just that those little textures that help make an album great seem here to have been confined to a caged death match for control of moonchild. there is some good playing but really this is closer to something like cream than a lot of people realize... there is just a jazz spin on it.,0
some extraordinary bits the first two songs and some pretentious bits on this debut by prog-art-rock kings.,0
fripp-a-dip.good but kind of snurly.that might not be a real word but snurly just about covers it.,0
when i was a tot my dad kept his records in an old antique oak chest in the sitting room. i used to be fascinated by this chest and would often nose through all the dusty vinyls studying the myriad of colourful and psychedelic images that adorned his mostly sixites based collection. this was probably before i could even read properly. to me all those gatefold albums were like giant picture books. then one day i came across this. the front cover freaked me out a little. that guy looks kind of distressed. but that was nothing compared with when i opened up the gate and holy fuck this moonfaced acid fried freak of an image was staring out at me with a doped out glare of such evil malice i might possibly have wet myself there and then. for whatever reason that image stayed with me and for a month i had nightmares about moonface. he would be stalking in my room late at night possessed by some strange intoxicating madness ready to steal me from my bed and drag me underground with all the other moonface folk. to this day that image makes me feel so fucking... uneasy. ahem. this is quite a good album by the way.,0
on paper it should be a brilliant album but it just comes off too childish to work. the first song 21st century schizoid man with mirrors is the best.,0
i do not know if it is mostly for nostalgic reasons but i really enjoy this album. it has a certain dreamy feel to it and luckily frippco. did not drown the compositions or theme of the album in their usually boring proggy guitar riffs and bombastic solos.,0
this is a very historically important album. it is not my favourite king crimson release though. here is how i feel when i listen to it track 1 right on! track 2 nyah. not bad. track 3 zzzzzzzz. track 4 huh!? oh yah zzzzz. track 5 sweet! in the end you are left wonder just how good the album was because you did not really absorb half of it. i would rather listen to bill bruford era king crimson. larks tongues in aspic red and discipline are just the beginning of the amazing output he was part of.,0
i have tried god knows i have tried to love king crimson. i am so tired of people telling me that if i like yes i should adore king crimson down to robert fripps rockin guitar stool. and yes there are two -- two! -- brilliant tracks here 21st century schizoid man and the court of the crimson king. yet i also hear a flacid jam titled moonchild an overwrought epitaph and a limp ballad i talk to the wind. there is just something chilly and misanthropic about most of the music here that leaves me cold. let us face it it are not no ummagumma. and i think i prefer yes to crimson because yes is always at bottom no matter how pretentious a pop group. but i would give fripps exposure album a handy five stars. go figure.,0
it might be over-produced it sounds very constructed. but overall it is a very impressive and creative album. the first hip-hop album i actually enjoyed and that gave me hope i might maybe one day appreciate the genre. only 3.5 stars because i really have a problem appreciating hiphop this album included. it is a genre i always found very non musical and uninteresting. the whole talking and posing thing the bombastic lyrics i could never suffer them. but it might grow on me more hopefully. musically it is nothing incredible but definitely it is interesting and well produced. lots of interesting sound effects and rhythms it is definitely more diverse and catchy than most hiphop albums.,0
tm levy sattumalta osui minulle tubesa ja sen kuuntelin lpi nyt tn pivn niin tytyy sanoa ett osittain pidn ja osittain en mutta kun vlill se kaupallisuus menee sinne huonolle puolelle eli painotan kuuntelijan aliarviointia kun mennn vlill sielt miss aita matalalla ja setelinkuvat silmiss mentaliteetilla kosiskellen isoja massoja ns huonolla kaupallisella tavalla ja ei sellaisia kohtia jaksa oikein kuunnella mutta vlill musajutut on parempia joten albunmi jtt vhn neutraalin fiilikset minulle mutta 35 on hyv arvosana johon ei aina kaikki yll. musiikillisesti bndi kyll on lahjakas tytyy kehua siit. rauhoittaa mys mielen aika ajoin. kotona bndi parhaimmillaan hitaissa ja puolihitaissaja yksi biisi jonkun verran leijuvan tuntuinen jotenki se on tosi hyv eli viittaan biisiin institutionalized joka on minusta levyn jopa kirkkaasti paras teos.,0
used to like this more until i learned of better rappers draingang and sadboys.,0
i have given this album so many chances over the years as i do with a lot of massively popular and highly rated albums just to make sure i am really not missing anything or that it will one day click with me. sadly that click rarely happens and i got to chalk it up to just different taste. sellmeagods review puts it best when they said to pimp a butterfly is an intriguing album and cultural event that reveals less with more listening when people talk about this album it always feels like they are talking about the idea of it rather than the actual music. i cannot deny the ambition of kendrick on this album but it really comes across as him doing a whole lot to say very little. his flows are on point he occasionally has a poignant lyric but half the time it feels like he is just filling space. brevity is a virtue for me and this album seems to have everything except that. almost every song could have been at least 1 minute shorter. luckily this is a problem he fixed on his followup damn. - which makes it a much better album in my opinion i think the overarching theme of the album was kind of interesting but its not a pleasant experience hearing i remember you was conflicted after every single song. i get it you do not need to spoonfeed me the concept line by line because it just kills any momentum that the few great songs on here have. its a decent album with a mixed bag of songs ranging from amazing to just plain sleepy. the album cover tricks you into believing this is a rebellious or transgressive work of art but the majority of the content is just plain inoffensive which should be evident by the obama cosign. feels like this is massively overrated by white people who want to prove how much they think black lives matter or how woke they are when i could name at least 30 rap albums more deserving of a 3 overall ranking but are not as politically correct,0
...i truly do not get how this has the status it does this album is always seen as some grandiose political statement that it simply is not. the music itself is great and we all know kendrick does the raps the singles own in particular. i just think it is hollow. it never goes beyond losing obama almost a verbatim bar and such. for me kendrick was always better on the smaller scale. i love gkmc to bits because it is a small-scale hood documentary that truly is one of the best ever at what it does. this is trying to be massive. it is not massive and at severe risk of targeting the rym userbase not at all as politically profound as many many of the older acclaimed albums you know the ones. this review is garbage i am drunk and feel ill edit it is genuinely a bit upsetting that this is considered the best political album on here. its his flashiest i get it but has almost nothing to say that literally all his other records do not do better and kendrick has never had that much to say in the first place the reason good kid m.a.a.d city is so good is because it is humble and does what it does really well. this tries to do it all and achieves little i just realized i said the same thing before but whatever. god that fucking poem bit at the end of every song is obnoxious and the conclusion is even more so unrewarding as fuck. dude 2pac lmao. i am sure that was epic to someone the first time they heard it so fantastic for them but are people still really getting mindblown by that? treads the line between being zoomer music and oldhead i.e reactionary music so hard that i guess it makes sense but fuck me this would be such a shit 1.,0
i remember playing this for the first time when it dropped. i was shocked by how many songs i did not care for minus alright. i tried to get into it that year but just could not. i ended up shelving it until 2021 and gave it another more in depth listen. good kid mad city and damn are definitely better than this release. the production just is not as good. i do not think most of these beats were that great when it was released and especially now. the album just never reached the highpoints his other releases did. too many beats that are just generic sounding or average. the rhyming is there but the production falters. these beats sound like watered down version of the music groups like blackalicious was making in the early 2000s. some of these hooks are irritating as well. i am surprised how much hype this got then and still. lyrically at times it feels like i am being preached too or it is almost a diary at times for himself. the insight is nice but it harms replay value. i love public enemy but you got to be in the right mood to play certain kinds of music and after you hear this release a few times the concept is very apparent.,0
beautiful album beautiful beat i love life and myself,0
i have talked about how the wall by pink floyd is one of the most over rated albums of all time. it is a good album but i am beginning to hate it because people ignore it is obvious flaws. to pimp a butterfly is in the same category as the wall. it is great jazzy conscious hip hop. but to say it is perfect is a stretch. it is a slog. the repeating poem wears thin and the pay off is not interesting in my opinion. institutionalized hood politics and momma are not enjoyable. the interludes are also not great. b-b-b-b-but the lyrical content is important. yeah i agree. does not make it good though. maybe i have just become worn out when it comes to this album. every hip hop circle is just 16 year old white kids telling you how perfect this album is and that it is the best album of all time.,0
continue with the third act........... reviewing every single fantano 1010 albums that he gave 3 to pimp a butterfly. my goal is to review every single fantano 1010 albums that he gave since he started his youtube channel. not even a full year later fantano dropped another untimely 1010 bomb on the internet. this time the bomb incredible huge. fantano review of tpab is by far his most watched video on his video on his channel. so now to the review. this album is means a lot to me. hip hop is the first music genre i listen to and surprisingly to pimp a butterfly was the first album i have ever listen to. i started listening to albums early march of 2021 back then i did not know much about music. the only music i heard was the most popular songs on radio and meme songs. it did not spark my interest in music at all. everything changed one day in march i heard to pimp a butterfly for the first time. before that i was listening to spotify keep repeating wesley theory and humble on repeat. at the time i never knew that to pimp a butterfly was so highly praise. i just enjoy a couple of kendricks songs. unexpectedly i had another level of enjoyment in music that i never had. the music was so catchy that keep me intrigued the whole time without knowing any lyrics that kendrick was actually rapping about. i just love his voice love what music i heard. in my opinion to pimp a butterfly is like a diary. as 16 tracks is about kendrick lamar life living as a colored person in the united states. as kendrick lamar explains topics about love family things he faced in life as a kid. this album blends everything black music culture such as jazz soul and funk. as jazz samples are all over the album. with incredible very chopped jazz samples and kendrick smooth flow fits perfectly. as kendrick lamar writes his diary every single day. he gone through the brightest and darkest moments in life. to pimp a butterfly is very relatable to me. kendrick lamar on this album is just a normal person as kendrick lamar used songs to shows his progression in life. with the first track of wesley theory explains about kendrick meeting love for the first time explaining his raw deep feelings about it. the track king kunta showing how he is so proud living in compton. the following track institutionalized with bilal and snoop dogg protrays as his grandparents their impression about kendrick lamar. the track these walls with kendrick lamar expressing about love and sex like a normal person. he is very sincere about everything he said. but noticing that the girl he just fucked is a bitch and actually does not care about him which is quite heartbroken if you ask me. the track you fixed perfectly on the next track with kendrick lamar expressing his anger after suffering some problems in life. as the track alright is more than a protest song. this track is an encouragement song with kendricks parents encourage him not to give up with its heartwarming after knowing the previous kendrick lamar at his lowest and darkest point. after the track momma we reached teenage kendrick. as kendrick started knowing about politics as he realise his life was not actually that good as he thought. the track hood politics with kendrick lamar just mocking and do not give a fuck up about politics. but the track the black the berry is oppositing as he express his issues about the police killing innocent black people and expressing his honest thoughts about it. this track is where the emotion got to and all time high. as the lyrics in the black the berry goes i am the biggest hypocritic of 2015. some tracks such as how much a dollar cost and complexion are things that kendricks experience that he encounter in his life. as the track how much a dollar cost as he met a homeless person chasing him just to get money to live explaining how unfair the world is to everyone. the track complexion as talking about complex things in life with forgiveness is given as it determine by your skin color. as he express he is proud being a black person. as the track i kendrick lamar goes on stage and give a confident speech and a performance. as his diary is complete 15 tracks in. as the last track mortal person talking about forgiveness and accountability about peoples mistakes such as michael jackson doing shitty stuff and still be forgiven as innocent and power justice that nelson mandela brought independence to south africa. it is just sad. the music slows down and kendrick lamar reads his diary to tupac shakur. a person that kendrick lamar admired a lot. tupac and kendrick lamar are talking casually as tupac mentioned about black people has 5 years to live otherwise they would be trap in controlled by rich white people. kendrick lamar ended the album with a poem of explaining the title of the album to pimp a butterfly. the album is an entire full circle. this album truly means a lot me. i get emotional when listening to this and had appreciation listening to music. to pimp a butterfly changed my way i listen to music music has a true meaning. its not just fun music and also could impact peoples life and i am of those people who got impacted by this album. i have no words of this album i love this album in my heart after listening to the entire album three different times yet every track feels special and unique. he used previous ideas pioneer by the roots and a tribe called quest yet made their ideas into perfection with this album. kendrick lamar is one of my favourite musician of all time. kendrick lamar is the best rapper to ever touch the mic. he impacted how music could be used. i will always love this album forever. fav tracks wesleys theory for free? king kunta insitutionalized these walls you alright for sale? interlude momma hood politics how much a dollar cost complexion a zulu love the blacker the berry you are not got to lie momma said i mortal man least fav tracks na 1010 perfect album,0
i think it goes without saying that a huge portion of this albums critical success is due to stupid american politics. to no ones surprise i suppose hip hop has always thrived as political commentary. i think this album is incredibly overrated but i do not think it is bad. i will say the lyrical themes i do appreciate on this album are the ones concerning mental health. from a pure sonic perspective this album succeeds in incorporating a vast array of musical influences and is often just really satisfying to listen to. of course it needs to be said this album is 1h18m long and at least half of that is filler. this is a common issue i find with hip hop albums. to name a few favourites the intense and emotional you the aggressive the blacker the berry and the unique and interesting king kunta.,0
this is a good album it is about kendrick lamar screaming at white people in a funny voice. of course being the masochists that they are white people grew to love this album especially the ones that look like this  however i already heard this done better before it is this little album called black on both sides you might have heard of it it is the album that is this but better in every way and made 20 years earlier but this has a poem about 2pac in it that unfolds throughout the record. because of that this is deeper than other albums that came out in 2015 according to critics. you know the year that tetsuo  youth and days with dr yen lo came out. good job tourists you were wrong again. this album is funky and jazzy which is rare in rap nowadays so it gets a 710 by default.,0
i love kendrick i even love this album but it just is one that can be super hard to digest. i have to work to listen to it and that is not bad but it does mean that i find myself coming back to this album less than others in his discog. the album as a whole is super important and i get why it is so loved i just find it hard to listen to in full at times where as gkmc and damn are more relistenable,0
most overrated album on the rym charts just insanely overhyped and overshadowed by gkmc.,0
this is that kind of rap for intellectuals praise of which i do not understand. that kind of rap rich and educated 25-30yos play at the parties convinced it is banger but actually forcing half of the less unique people to leave or at least to change the room. to be honest i could not find anything interesting about this album except its political message. it is drastically overproduced and hi-budget but at the same time it is not catchy at all. also it is full of useless jazziness in some tracks. lamars rapping is good but these songs are completely uninteresting. still it is not that bad that i would be the person who is leaving the party or complain about music. i just do not get it.,0
you cannot talk about this album without the term album of the decade being thrown about. finally i have listened to the album that seems to be the most unanimous decision for the best album of the 2010s and unfortunately i think it is a 7.5 out of 10. unforunately? yes unfortunately. if there is been one artist that is been a pain to listen to in recent discography runs it would have to be kendrick. this man is hailed as some kind of god when it comes to his craft and there is something about his music that is understandably different perhaps the increased jazz influences that are present are a big enough differentiating factor or the mans idiosyncratic voice. something is missing for me. i think it sounds undoubtedly good but i wanted great amazing superb to be the descriptors i would use here. this album feels to me at least like perfect background music. maybe that is sacrilege but i just could not fully connect with it and i find that to be a real shame. or maybe my expectations were way too high because of everything i had heard about this album. regardless this album is basically essential at this point so go listen to it. i mean it is an average rating of 4.24 at the time of writing this so i am in the minority. go enjoy this. rating - 7.5,0
obama rap in which k-dot points out the pertinent political issues facing the black american and subsequently retreats into personal ennui - weaponising bourgeois identity politics to mask the clear lack of ideas and structural criticism that define great conscious rap albums. the beats still sound fresh though,0
no highlights like there on gkmc.. wesleys theory got a 4.6 rating ?!! this rating should be given to absolute classics.. not a song with zombie noises and sexed up burps.. moreover kendricks vocal here is little annoying and less diverse than that on gkmc.. it sounds pretentiously harsh all over the record and misses his softfun characteristic vocal that can be found on his earlier releases.. the production and delivery in total are not that interesting and can get boring oftentimes.. 510,0
1  5 in the mid 2010s hip hop became a mainstream sensation and kendrick lamar lead that expedition. everyone was hyping up his steps. this record transformed his image he quickly fell from man of the future to man of the hour literally the one who tied the present and the past. the very concept of the record making an ode to all black music up until that point weighted so much promotionally that suffocated his idea of self in innovation. the record is structurally confusing ultra pretentious and well produced at the same time a weird and rare combination. it is an undeniable epic that forced mainstream enthusiasts into an actual experience if anything it could be praised for that. definitely a faux masterpiece.,0
kendrix we love you but cmon dude. what the heck is this? brother we been in the shit. i dislike the ratatap tap of the drums i hate the voice of kendrix but i had to listen. i loved the second track most holy crap it was mediocre but everything else made me get hurt in the head. i cannot listen to music i need pills this is thanks to kendrix.,0
lots of tracks on here help to paint a picture of an individual trapped in a violent society who sees their only way out as lsd. the production here directs a specific image and meaning akin to ok computer dark sid eof the moon and a night at the opera. thus the production is on point but takes away a lot of the fun from music as i see it it is interpretive nature. this is an album hell bent on making a point. the only song that gets above this is the masterpiece the blacker the berry. it is a step above all other songs here in both concept and meaning. overall this album is packed with top-down songs and vulnerable expressions. tightly wrapped in a well developed concept with humility brings the whole album to 4.5.,0
kendrick sure improved with this album because good kid maad city was boring and here the music is better. the beats are more diverse and creative and the rapping sure improved his voice is a little less squeaky in this album and the jazz influence is cool but this album certainly is far from being a masterpiece. decent album but not even close to a masterpiece.,0
to pimp a butterfly 2015 by kendrick lamar is not unlike a basketball game. according to mr. lamar the nba finals are now contested between the sixers and the warriors. mr. lamar is about to enter that tense moment. he has written an op-ed piece for the local media. it does not go well. that is the world that he has created for himself. now he finds himself in the path of a fast-moving ocean. his younger sister jessie is pregnant with his son who will become a future member of the nba. now he must choose between his basketball and his family. to pimp a butterfly is a devastatingly compassionate piece of work. but for someone who is continually hidden under a gown which makes her almost invisible to the public the drag queens true name remains one of the most intimate secrets of her public life. kendricks personal journey to on fleek as well as the evolution from child stars to rock star. listen in as kendrick takes listeners through the most epic moments of his amazing career including his acclaimed songwriting career his battles with depression and addiction his rise to the top of the rap game and now the pivotal moment of his marriage. he has come a long way since then to be on this list but he has only gotten better over the years. much like cookie monster brian has seemed to grow a lot over the years. in conclusion kendrick lamar or anyone else has shown that the relevance of hebrew and its use and meaning is the number one selling point to a lot of music fans. with his considerable fame and influence a lot of his music has gone through a much longer process of translation and meanings than other work. with his western fanbase for them the work comes from the heart and they admire his impeccable line skill and professional execution. but the german rapper still has a lot of work to do in terms of giving back to the world with his upcoming album revival which is expected to be released in january.,0
mostly noise. i do not understand how people this to this shit? kendricks also used far too many samples making this album very unoriginal. i really have no interest in hearing a small portion of a classic 60s song in the middle of a hip-hop song just sounds fucking awful to me and whenever i hear these samples it ruins the song for me. i enjoyed king kunta and the blacker the berry when i first listened to them but that was when i was 16 and those songs have not aged well at all king kunta is boring and has no replay value. fuck you kendrick.,0
i believe what makes to pimp a butterfly so revered is the fact that it is simply a really flexible rich concept album with a clear steady and extensive narrative that goes great with the music and the lyrics. what is more impressive is the way kendrick mixes personal struggles with identity various life shifts ideal changes and match them to near perfection against the struggles of his people which gives depth to each and every song. the use of jazz in the fore and background in this record also helps emphasize strong senses of ethnicality imbued through and through implying thoughts of roots and foundations. as exhaustive and terrifyingly ambitious as this record seems at first it is however entirely encased in a very grounded accent as if made and written by someone who is spent the last 25 years in a prison cage alone with various contemplations jaded yet sneakily hopeful. it is both sincere and boastful it is maddening and sweet at the same time. these constant malleable overtones of duality can be seen most clearly in the very lucid egocentric verses and poetic insanities that dominate the closing track. to pimp a butterfly might not be the exact cup of tea for lovers of good kid m.a.a.d city as it might be too serious too sombre or whatever have you but as a work of art it has surpassed its prequel per se. it is genius creative insightful vivid wonderful and absolutely shocking in a good way. i strongly recommend you give this gem more than one replay. highlights king kunta mortal man alright the blacker the berry how much a dollar cost wesleys theory i lowlights for free? interlude for sale? interlude complexion a zulu love you are not got to lie momma said,0
packed with commanding performances ambitious sonics and a who is-who of contributors from anna wise to clinton to thundercat butterfly is a massive presentation. lamar is superlative pulling an arsenal of choice samples and jazzy interludes to accent his trademark variable-flow delivery musicians and guests applying themselves passionately to an album that screams out the plight of 21st century african american life. creating backdrops to diverse themes like the seduction of fame depression hypocrisy black-on-black violence and multi-angle views of racism butterfly is a surreal experience of cleverly connected songs. it is a clich but the effect of the spoken-word interludes intros outros and complex arrangements are truly cinematic like a movie of the mind. it is preachy and full of shifting moods but despite all of the expressions of discontent he packs in some next-level jams. king kunta transforms the darkest subject matter into the sickest beat pure west coast groove  funky as all getout. these walls is more of the same smooth and scintillating with mellow jazzy flourishes splashing against an irresistible tempo and complexion is absolutely gorgeous languid soul-drenched loops against layered vocals that resolve in rhapsodys crescendo-like rap finale. it is an album that requires a certain mood to digest. there is a lot to unpack but like most top-tier concept records it reveals its true gold time and time again over multiple listens. undoubtedly one of the most daring hip hop records of the last ten years.,0
listen kendrick let us make things clear here. i appreciate your intentions. seriously. on paper an ambitious convoluted and lush concept rap album on the struggles of modern america seems like a really orgasmic idea concluding it with an interview to 2pac filling it with tons of little self-referencing details building an entire world and imaginary in it all can be really intelligent ideas. you are very good at writing lyrics i admit that. i have not read much but for what i have read  purely regarding your verses  i have liked that. but we are not there. we are not there at all. the songs often seem to be completely directionless feel like totally devoid of purpose. let us say it loud and clear you can stay on beat and maybe you have even got poetry inside of you but musically you suck. the beat is almost always basic and without elements of interest not to say usually constructed on a heinous usage of tacky synths. the construction of the song is always fragmented interrupted by every kind of bullshit ugly soul-ish choirs useless samples several scene tricks without any logical sense to them like that sort of mini-recitation at the start of for sale?? what even was that? that leave you absolutely nothing. nothing at all. you cannot maintain pathos for more than what thirty seconds? and how many refrains can i remember after this listen? the one from king kunta the one from wesleys theory the one from alright maybe the one from these walls? and the rest? zero. and let us not talk about the delivery for gods sake. do you know why i stopped reading your lyrics more or less at the 6th or 7th song? because your timbre and the way you interpret flow make me puke. consequently i could not care less about what exactly you are saying since the base level of emotional engagement the immediate one is irreparably lost already. for gods sake not a time where you let energy rise not a time where you come close to a visceral mood not a time where you take some courage in your hands. the main noble exception is the blacker the berry which in fact is by a wide margin one of the most spot on songs in the whole album. on there you look like someone who has something to say. the rest of the time you just sit there and babble some gibberish with your tone that feels almost mocking always annoying and let me say that to you buddy you come in one ear and you come out the other. without leaving a trace. not one time the arrangements pull out some magic trick some wildcard. if all your songs were arranged with the same creativity of i or for free this would be a good album. but it is not. it is a collection of songs perfectly designed to leave you nothing. you get exceptions sure but they feel like oases in the desert. a desert that much like a real one leaves you with a nasty dry feeling in your mouth. i am sure that if i were black  or paradoxically even just had english as my main tongue  i would have sensed more on my skin your very struggle maybe i would have forgiven the countless imprecisions that make to pimp a butterfly a mediocre record or maybe they would have had less importance maybe i could have closed an eye on some stuff. sadly this is not the case and for me you are  and apparently will always be since not even when i put myself into it i can bring myself to like you  an embarrassingly mediocre musician. i swear on god that if one day you make a record where beats song constructions arrangements etc. are made by someone else and you only take care of the rapping i swear that i will give you another chance. until then get out of my sight. italian version spoiler click to read,0
the way he juxtaposes jazz with hip hop makes for a cool sound on a number of tracks although the album overall is clearly in the hip hop genre - there is not much of what i would call genre bending or fusion going on here. these walls is a pretty good straight pop track. many of the lyrics are political which is a turn off to me even if i agree with the politics. there are plenty of niggas and bitches referenced on this too - par for the course for this genre. if that does not bother you or you find it liberating it is not an issue. some of the tracks are funny. overall really cool sounds decent variety in the musical approach the singingrapping is ok but nothing special. i need to get to know this better but it does not stand out as anything special after a few listens.,0
make no mistake no other album from this decade will be remembered as fondly as this album by the public at large. it represents the focus on mainstream hip-hop as well as a greater focus on large-scale social consciousness and political activism. this album presents itself as a personal reflection of african-american culture and its place in culture at large in america. however after reading into the album one inch below the surface you can see that it is anything but the grand presentation it puts on. to pimp a butterfly is the epitome of woke capitalism and an effort to manufacture politics like another product. the main strength of the album that is referenced in many reviews is the lyrical contents of the album. outside of any evaluation of the content of these lyrics it must be affirmed that there is a difference between lyrics and music. lyrical contents will never replace musical expression. poetry is not music and when expressing a means to make art it is the duty of the artist to determines the greatest medium to express their artistic desires. if this albums only redeeming quality is lyrical content no matter how good that lyrical content is is not fit to be music. the transformation of the poetry created into song must be seen as the commercialization of creativity it is. of course there is more to this album than the lyrical contents which will be explored in more depth later in the review. the production is praised on this album for the use of funk rb jazz and soul samples with live instrumentation from artists like kamasi washington. this is where the first failure of many critics emerges in evaluating tpab. this is not to say the production overall is negative on the album. in fact the first third of the album has some great cuts on it. the first three tracks are representative of what i think many people think of when reflecting on the album. however this production only declines as the album continues. the second half of the album is riddled with generic rb elements. with all of the different influences from african-american culture trying to get their moment in the spotlight the album fails to form a melodic identity. tpab is to an overview of black music as it is a small world after all is to a college seminar on history. on a single sitting these elements of genre tourism become irksome to say the least. with every track in the album clocking in at an average 4-5 minutes tpab is an endurance marathon with a final 12-minute ego jerk as kendrick has a make-believe interview with the legendary deceased rapper 2-pac. the double album has the material to make one 1010 single lp but that is not what is presented. the real focus of the album the lyrics come off as artificial at best. any real insight in this album is a repeat of what kendrick already stated more eloquently in his previous album. the newer lyrical parts of the album come off as a milquetoast version of fear of a black planet by public enemy. the themes of african empowerment are so much stronger from public enemy that is a wonder that it has not received as positively as this album. it could be perhaps that kendricks lyrics are political but hip enough not to draw heavy critique. in this sense this album presents what is already safe to say and accepted by a large portion of the public. it is an expression of the mainstream and the establishment. this album presents a revolution. this revolution has been televised and whored to the masses brought to you by the same label as imagine dragons maroon 5 and carly rae jepsen.,0

this album is not bad but it is a bit overrated. the lyrics are not that great and the instruments are decent but not more than any rock or jazz record. it is not 1010. it is more like 6.5 - 710. in mortal man i think the album misses a chance to have a great finish kendrick yelling pac at finish. it is a 10 minute length songpoem decided to 2pac. and other songs are actually about gold diggers and how obama is not care about black people at all. it has plenty of good songs but it is not 1010. come on people...,0
published through the same label as maroon 5 imagine dragons tokio hotel or selena gomez -- and it is showing. calculated and trite pop-oriented sound without an ounce of the freshness and urgency golden age hip hop had. after the very good opener and decent follow-ups the album sinks into indistinct hibernation and never awakens again. monotone politically aware rapping over equally sleepy jazz instrumentals inbetween some run-of-the-mill rb and party songs. is this supposed to be the best music had in store in 2015 one of the best albums of all time?,0
i completely understand the praise it gets but some of the music just is not for me. lyricism is definitely at a top tier level though. deserves the reputation it has.,0
this album is full of juvenile lyrics that i cannot get into and the music if you can call it that was repetitive and obnoxious. a few synthesized chords on a repetitive cycle how did this guy get a record contract? i know because there is enough people out there that think this is cool.,0
i know this is viewed as kendricks best work but i am not big on this album. i can see why it is so well-liked though. the production is very good and the album feels cohesive. however the musical style throughout much of this album jazz rap soul is just not something i enjoy very much. the highlights on this album are very strong though. 6.210,0
butterfly is objectively engaging - it is a long and varied record. the blacker the berry is staggeringly furious and i found myself listening to it again and again before sitting down with the whole album. when i did i was thrown by the endless backing vocals the densely poppy vocoder shite and lamars odd propensity for changing his own voice which is irritating. as a confection it is overwhelming it is massive sprawling there is about a billion collaborators on like every song and by the end of the rambling mortal man and the rich hip hop kaleidoscope that this album is i found myself longing for the sober focus that so caught me on berry. hell of an achievement though and i am not at all denying it deserves its lofty critical perch.,0
admito sem nenhuma vergonha que quando o disco do kendrick lamar foi sugerido eu j torci o nariz. detesto hype them cima de qualquer tipo de msica o tipo de coisa que acontece o tempo todo alguma revista ou site nos dias de hoje grande e descolada elogia logo os hipsters comeam a gostar e de repente todo mundo  entendido da msica do sujeito e them pouco tempo o disco se torna a melhor coisa que j foi desovada nesse mundo. pra mim isso  exatamente o que eu sinto quando o nome kendrick lamar aparece them qualquer lugar. de certa forma eu no estou errado to pimp a butterfly est longe de ser a abominao que eu estava esperando mas tambm est h anos de luz de ser a obra-prima que todos clamam ser. eu no sou o mais entendido them hip hop ento obviamente minha base para comparao  pequena. mas no geral eu ouo msica ouvindo a msica e no tentando fazer comparao com o prximo grande nome e tentando ser o entendido no assunto. no ouo o tipo de msica que kendrick lamar faz e no pretendo comear a ouvir aps este disco. nada mudou. o disco  longo demais diversos momentos poderiam ter sido limados para criar um disco com maior unidade. as letras? o pouco que eu realmente prestei ateno no me diz nada. resumindo ok. no mudou a minha vida e o hype no foi sustentado.,0
it is a damn good album with a lot of good tracks including wesleys theory king kunta institutionalized alright the blacker the berry and hood politics. that being said it is clearly not perfect and a lot of you are either a. praising it because you feel like you have to for some reason or b. have not listened to a lot of music especially hip hop. maybe it is both but this album has clear shortcomings and is inferior to a whole lot of other hip hop albums. much of it sounds overbearing and this is coming from a jazz fan. sometimes the music flat out does not serve the song even if it is well crafted. for instance in wesleys theory which i do like to reiterate kendrick raps like he is trying to cram as much as possible. also the music is an odd choice paired with the intended subject matter. yeah it is funk with a george clinton feature and all but why? i am confused with what i am suppose to feel with the track? just energetic? it is like ideas were considered before actual effective use of the medium. he incorporated funk and i get it is a black genre i get funk is basically a genre that warps and bends which kendrick is trying to do clearly given the title of the album and wesleys theorys lyrics cover how things are going to change with a black perspective but it flat out feels and sounds out of place. alot of this album works better in theory than execution. you want to make an angry song you get some anger in that sound like in blacker the berry. some tracks just do not nail down the feeling. also the lyrics are not that dope folks. there are a lot of contrived annoying stuff going on booboo? how he raps on you? mortal man?. flows are fine i have heard better from a lot of other releases check the extinction agenda nocturnal hell even atrocity exhibition. finally the general idea of this album is not that hard to get to. i do not know how this is perceived as genius. digable planets did this in a more clever and better way with blowout comb in the last millennium. still though kendrick is dope and even though there are clear flaws even in songs i like a lot it is still cool when it works and though it is not a transcendent unbelievably perfect release it is still dope. now shut up and just bob your heads and stop being so overly dramatic,0
considering all the praise this album gets i was expecting a masterpiece however this is not the case. the album certainly starts off strong with wesleys theory and for free being the best tracks on the album. unfortunately for the most part it only goes downhill from here. this album has the same problem every kendrick lamar album has it is way too long. a lot of the tracks are much longer than they need to be and this is only more apparent with the amount of repetition on this album. a poem is read several times throughout the album and it did not need to be. absolutely nothing was gained from doing it that way. many songs on this album have several verse that are either entirely identical or have 1 or 2 different lines. there is 1 track i want to go in depth on because it showcases every problem i have with this album. the track i am referring to is the last track on the album mortal man. mortal man is my least favourite song of all time no exaggeration. it is such a perfect storm of shit that it is the main reason i dislike this album. but i will get into that later. mortal man can roughly be divided into 3 sections song poem and interview. the track as a whole but primarily the song and interview portions of the track is unnecessarily long and repetitive. if you look at the lyrics for mortal man you will notice that it is extremely long. however upon closer inspection you will see that a bunch of it is just repeating what was said before. it is followed by kendrick reading the poem we have heard so many times before. if this was the first or second time we heard it i would be okay with it but by now it is lost all meaning. it is then revealed that he was reading this poem to tupac which then begins the part of the track that i have heard the most praise about the interview section. kendrick takes an interview with tupac and attempts to make it seem like a regular conversation. this while good in concept is poorly executed in my opinion. it still feels like an interview kendrick does not respond much to tupacs responses like you would in a regular conversation and instead asks other questions so that it will fit with what tupac said in the interview that is being sampled. the conversation just feels disjointed and unnatural. i have a few minor complaints about some of the stuff he says in this section but as that does not affect the quality of this album i will refrain from saying anything. even though i have been mostly negative there are things this album does well. the instrumentals are great and the concept of jazz rap seems very appealing to me i feel like it could be better executed.,0
re-assessment of hip-hop 6 kendrick lamar as of 2017 has overtaken kanye west as the most artistically acclaimed rapper. indeed the first tracks on this album show signs of at least matching the creativeartistic prowess of kanyes my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. the eccentric electronic composition surrounding wesley theory and the creative jazz incorporated into for free? signal that the album might be one of the more creative hip-hop albums ever produced. however the tracks king kunta institutionalized and these walls destroy this hope by returning to the fatal and needless formula that plagues the rest of hip-hop lounge music consisting of a drum beat with minimalist accompaniment. in fact these walls gets rid of the beat and simply transforms into outright lounge music. some semblance of atmosphere is recovered in you with it is sleepy jazz instrumentals and a somewhat manic vocal delivery. this glimmer of atmosphere is crushed again by alright. the following six tracks are a trial of pure suffering to listen through being languid rb tracks with sleepy vocals. the blacker the berry is an extremely run-of-the-mill attempt at hardcore hip-hop. the album then finishes with another borecore rb piece an extremely run-of-the-mill party song and finally a 12 minute long piece of lounge music interspersed with mediocre beat poetry. final verdict 310 terrible,0
i quite like the beats and kendricks vocal style but i could do without the childish lyrics. also this record seems to have been resposible for a load of similar cash-in political albums in 2016. as much as i feel for black people in the us at times this sort of protest record leaves me cold.,0
this album has a great sample to start it off and then people try to rap and it loses all legitimacy. most ordinary vanilla ass average hip hop album of all time. any critic who rates this album as good should be embarrassed. it sounds more like rb than hip hop. no one rapping on this album should be ever be considered a descent rapper. their flows are boring and fail to bring out their lyrical content. i cannot say i hate this album because whenever i listen to it i am stuck in a sort of daze where i do not hate it but i feel as though i am constantly waiting for it to do something. it is the epitome of popular hip hop i cannot understand why people think this is some transcendent album to be remembered as one of the greatest of all time.,0
kendrick lamar has taste in music but it sounds little more than a poor mans fear of a black planet to me.,0
i have always tried so hard to really really love kendrick lamar like everyone else does... but to me it is all a bunch of humble bragging. i believe he is trying to send a message but i keep on hearing me me me me me. it is nothing new for hip-hop. and he talks about his dick size in at least one song here. what a great role model for young people! same old same old. i do not care how experimental the approach is. the subject matter is nothing i have not heard before. and sheesh the album never ends!,0
the best out of kls 3 albums. the production of course is batshit crazy as always but kl here actually brings some more technical skill to his rapping. yeah it is still fucken weird but at least it does not sound lazy anymore. still i am never going to be able to get over the sound being so deeply rooted in rnb which i cannot stand so i am fooling myself to think i will ever be able to enjoy this album as much more than a curiosity.,0
this album belongs to the list of rare cases when i acknowledge how important and influential it is for so many people or the music in general but my own subjective taste does not let me recognize it as a masterpiece. it gets even weirder when i think how much i love the work of a few contributors and certain elements they bring in the record like for example the bass lines of thundercat or the production of flying lotus. anyway these distinct elements form the unique atmosphere and decorate appropriately kendrick lamars varied style and rhymes throughout the record and critically contribute to its deservedly characterization as an one-of-a-kind record. to pimp a butterfly will probably dominate most music fans or magazines lists at the end of the year but i am still not convinced and resisting to surrender to an although very powerful at the same time heavily influenced by politics and social matters album which usually is not part of my favorite music even though i highly respect. maybe it is just my impression that there is much potential in kendricks music to further expand his audience outside of hip hop. i have read that except collaborators they are good friends as well so i would love to hear a thundercat flying lotus and kendrick lamar avant-garde jazz rap record one day.,0
to pimp a butterfly has been lauded across the board as a gamechanger for the genre. i am unconvinced. undoubtedly it is got its moments - king kunta institutionalised you are not got to lie and mortal man are all standouts. musically it has more going on than most hip hop albums and is excellently produced. lyrically it does have a lot to say even if it cannot help itself with vulgarity. it is a solid effort deserving of a 7 or 8 out of 10. that is what i am giving it. i prefer east coast stuff.,0
appreciate the production which pulls from a number of genres old-school samples smooth beats jazz and funk. there is a really good flow between tracks and the guests do not detract from the album as they often tend to. despite all that it comes off as kind of dry in that not one song grabbed me. i appreciate conscious hip hop but the message was kind of lost here for me. good for a listen like a podcast but i do not see why i would want to revisit.,0
nothing like his other albums kendrick lamar got too many ideas in his head. cannot figure out if he wants to be a expirimental version of common. or a more political version of dre. boring as hell. some of these songs go on seemingly for forever. i do not agree with this whole thing bout this production being game changing or whatever. they are sleep inducing. kendrick is not too far from going full on pop star after making a song like alright and collabing with taylor swift.,0
it has some good sounds and some ideas... but i think he would have better forced them in 4-5 songs. sixteen are too much.,0
i quite enjoyed aspects of this the p-funkjazz and neo soul backing tracks he used in places especially. he is a goodstrong rapper and at times things get pretty intense. their is a strong political flavour to the record but it takes in other subjects like black on black crimedepression and sex. on the downside - a lot of spoken word sections that are boringthe album is way overlong and repetitive and some of the raps are downright irritating. i do accept i am probably not the target audience for this though. lol,0
an earnest album rather than a profound one. there is some okay beats here but too often it wears the gimmick of hip-hop with wacky sound effects. still endearingly strange and emotionally naked.,0
unimpressed by this as much as every reviewer everywhere in the universe seems to be impressed ... am i so out of the hip hop groove that it says nothing to me about my life? i will stick with chuck d circa 1988.,0
i was not all too convinced of this album. yes it is smooth and dynamic but lyrically i feel it is not as conscious as before. the tracks mixing jazz funk and soul to them were the ones i did like here but otherwise i felt rather oh whatever of the material. so there are some pearls here but the rest is rather bigtime boredom.,0
in all sincerity this one is a solid 3-3.5 but my vote reflects how overrated this record is in my opinion. nothing stands out immediately like his prior lp which is not a necessity but its coherence is also kind of a drag as well.,0
ok. people are waaay overreacting to what is a great record but not a classic nor the artists best. i will try to explain... shout out the yale herald in to pimp a butterfly the follow-up to 2012s good kid m.a.a.d city kendrick lamar takes an audacious step forward but also gets a little stuck in the past. his decision to tackle uncomfortable issues of social justice and self-doubt in this anticipated release is bold and new. his lyricism does not disappoint. but in crafting the sound of the album he shunned mainstream production in favor of throwback sounds. while this is smart in theory it does not completely work the project lacks sonic cohesion so it cannot be called a bona fide instant classic. i respect kendricks decision to draw in jazz and soul influences but some of the beats just are not fitting this coming from someone who counts something else and a love supreme among his all-time favorites. you is the emotional climax of the album and would be one of its best songs but for the vibe-killing instrumentation after the beat switches. the man is contemplating suicide and the best you can give him is a sad jazz sax? the lyrics are terrifying they deserve a terrifying instrumental. king kunta is fun but it offers little that suga free and dj quik did not do years ago. in general the album sounds too derivative. i am confused by critics who call joey bada anachronistic and kendrick a game-changing visionary in the same breath. it is revealing that the best song on the album both lyrically and sonically also boasts the most modern production. the menacing synths and thumping percussion of the blacker the berry plus the yeezus-citing dancehall bridge make an appropriate framework for the most memorable verses of the year i am african-american i am african  i am black as the heart of a fucking aryan. the title track is another clear highlight but begs the question why make a jazz-hop album in 2015 and only put flylo on one beat? last years never catch me displays an energy that this lp craves. i would have liked to see more of the fela kuti influence present on the closing track that afrobeat pioneer being one of kendricks more novel references. speaking of mortal man i love the audacity of the tupac sample but editing yourself into one of his interviews feels sacrilegious. it also adds length to an album that already seems bloated 79 minutes is a long runtime and there are a few tracks momma institutionalized that you could excise without compromising the albums message. the message is complex but compelling. he is mad and he lays into all he sees white america the music industry himself. the fact remains that kendricks lyrics are brilliantly devastating critics want to mention they miss when hip-hop was rappin motherfucker if you did killer miked be platinum. but i hear a deep disconnect between that message and the sounds that surround it. the day after to pimp a butterfly came out i was listening in the car with a friend. he remarked that the settingsun out windows downwas perfect for the smooth sound of the record and i had to agree. but later that night really digging into the lyrics i realized kendrick may have intended this to be a claustrophobic suffocating listen. this disconnect means to pimp a butterfly is not as instantly iconic as good kid m.a.a.d city but it is nevertheless a captivating story of racial tension and religious salvation and a worthy follow-up. 7.210 the blacker the berry wesleys theory hood politics,0
as letras so majoritariamente speras e them tom bem confessional e raivoso mesmo que por vezes estejam envoltas numa atmosfera bem soft. quanto ao instrumental com exceo de poucas faixas a eventual tentativa de ser simples me soa preguiosa. de resto a voz do cara no me desce mas a proposta dele  mais que aceitvel. the blacker the berry i e mortal man fogem absurdamente do padro das outras faixas ganhando destaque incontestvel. impressionante como isso deixa o lbum inconstante e desproporcional! e  a que sinto que o cara no vale todo esse oba oba. se ele  o maluco mais gabaritado pra representar o gnero no sculo xxi prefiro ficar com a galerinha de uns 25 anos atrs ou at mesmo com os modernosos aesop rock e criolo que no vivem tanto de lampejos.,0
i will willingly throw out there that i am not a particular fan of hip-hop and yet or perhaps because of i am already tired of these same old stories of misunderstood cult heroes of the relentlessly bleak hood life. call me some synonym of white but i have heard all of good kid maad city or whatever the hell the stylization is before in greater or no more a commanding voice. that ones success was as unsurprising as the album itself sounding every bit like a revival of late 90s conscious rap. predictably to pimp a butterfly follows the same direction as its inspirers. lamar digs doubly backwards to incorporate the same jazzfunksoul sounds as others have done before with the original shock impression having long faded by now. or maybe not considering tpabs reception. that or we all love a decent take on our old favorites. but this is not anything revolutionary and as such it will never start a revolution as much as it wants to. hell this album is literally black messiah with the genre chemical makeup rebalanced somewhat. remember that one? not many seem to and dangelo undeservedly did not even have as much hype. as implied earlier kendrick lacks a distinct forceful personality and that character influences the limits of his music. shoot did anyone really care about the struggle? maybe it is now left best bitching at idiotic rednecks on facebook who try and justicy the latest racial transgressions. do not collect 500 4.5 ratings. go directly to tetsuo  youth.,0
to pimp a butterfly is an intriguing album and cultural event that reveals less with more listening. its problems are best displayed on its best song king kunta which slams so hard with dj quik drumblams and a disco-rap bassline to recreate james brown for 2k15 but all building up to little more than a homage to funk heroes with a sick hook catchier than holden on some crazy cliff and underdeveloped verses. basically this track is how i feel about kendrick at his best  he does throw a thousand great influences together with talented musicians who can make it smooth a mosaic of beautiful sounds that adds up to no coherence. and he should rap more since he does have flow when he needs to on these verse fragments that we rarely get. one of his most important and exciting nuances is his narratorrapper split where you can never be sure how honest his rapping is  might he just be playing a character or an earlier version of himself as was often his method on his previous rekkerd? and sometimes this irony can work well. but more often it just creates unsolved confusion for us while we give him an undeserved pass for saying stuff that could end up meaning almost anything just cos meaning almost anything is a virtue no matter how unintentional. the yams are the powers that be but he also has got the yams so who knows how may rapgeniuses it is going to take to explain that bit of lyrical contradicting thoughtlessness? oh but it is ironic and dealing with dual-meanings...or something. i find it to be just lazy connections and it takes me out of that deep groove. and why is lifescreaming annie are you ok? other than to drop in a reference to an inspiration? it sounds cool but it is purposeless and inane. he gets into battle rap mode too infrequently on this album i guess in an effort to push rap forward or whatever common has been doing for a decade plus but when he does again i am divided. his strongest diss is aimed at biting rappers yall share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell while he concurrently plunders lines and deliveries from the payback among others which his fanbase will either ignore or celebrate as being meta-cool is he another voice here calling out himself? but i think he is just confusedly throwing everything around and hoping for a vague hip hopfunk song that hits it all at once. also how can dre not feel a bit hurt? i get much of the support for this album comes from it being introspective and still big-society condemning which is great except when it feels like his lines could mean anything or nothing. is he conscious of how wildly exaggerated it is to compare himself to mandela or haley? it seems that sometimes he is and sometimes he revels in that extreme ego  and again i want to applaud honesty but it is too loose and flying everywhere. we are supposed to praise its craft and attention to detail while also recognizing that some of its details are egotistical and underthought so that other than when he is bleating-screaming his hypocrite exorcism of himself as on the blacker the berry i am not sure how seriously he takes individual lines he is saying. obviously it is easier when goofy voices are putting on characters but these parts are even more problematic in being badly-rapped-for-sake-of-making-irony-apparent etc. essentially i am supposed to think it is good when it is not good because that shows his contradictory nature. intrigued at this albums task of trying to decode its puzzle i end up finding less and less meaning as i put it all together and find it is really not that deep. often it is just a display of a guys sometimes half-baked thoughts like any rap album great or not. will we still love him when his dirty secrets get out? is perhaps crossing a line uncomfortably while still seeming under-analyzed like any message board can i still like burzum? post. snippets of a poem that is so vague and underwritten flow throughout and for everyone who says there is a butterfly-symbology motifing in-n-out there is just as much randomness rap normalness love lyrics vague spiritualism etc. and then if it is throwing rap forward to year 3000 why do we still get long talking interludeskits with diminishing replay value saxophone careless-whispering outerludes and rap clichs galore? it is just not doing that much. cracked-open song structures this i can certainly get behind and wild genre bending is cool but none of it seems to match even lesser acclaimed albums that have been doing this thing in hip hop from 90s onward. spiral those walls into divine light instead! for how conceptual this album gets credit for being i see almost no coherence other than loose topics that many hip hop albums deal with anyhow with a particular focus on race. i also get that it is got mass appeal and high school kids will be blown away and that is great  it sounds radical for a mainstream rap album since kendrick so rarely does rap while still touching on enough elements to be understood by that audience and he is legions more self-aware than most rap videos will ever be. his referenced literature is likewise stuck in a high-school bookroom which helps. kids can easily pick up on those mockingbird parallels and achebe. but it is not getting near the coup in its politics and mouthful references or freestyle fellowship in its jazz-splunk spray or even some mainstream stuff that did get kendrick level support like outkast in its funk synthing spirituality. yes i am glad a new generation of 10th graders is hearing something out of their regular mold since it can get massive mainstream appeal and promotion but it is not changing anything for me.,0
i think this is better than his previous album. i like the way he uses jazz here. the theme here is somewhat less offensive.,0
while i will not try to argue my case on the message behind this work the music itself is not entirely great. jazzfunk production comes off as the flavor of the month in hip hop right now. 3-4 of the songs could also be cut as they sound like filler. i do not understand the high ratings this album is getting as its a 6.5 at its best and sounds like early black-eyed peas b-sides at worst. overall an exhausting overly preachy mess that many will find amusing because kendrick tells a tale of race that comes off as amazing in a hip hop environment riddled with catchy one liners and generic subject matter. 5.3-5.7.,0
am i the only person who thinks section 80 is his best album? the storytelling was more captivating the lyrics more fluid the politics less prevalent. he is trying hard to me a sociopolitical force and kudos to him for trying to leverage his importance. but this is music and he is no chuck d not yet,0
edit overall this grew on me and i would like to believe i am less of a prick now than i was when i wrote this. i will leave it be though it is kind of funny to me. i tried pretty hard to love this and i still feel a bit dumb for not getting it you know. but truth is i think i get it and still do not care too much for it. first of all let us give credit where credit is due the production on this thing is awesome. all over the place that is a recurring theme but awesome. i am a sucker for funk and there is a lot of it jazz influenced beats all over the place straight up jazz sometimes. overall i am really happy that kendrick went for a more instrumental kind of sound that is a pretty big gamble for someone in his position. now i will have to admit something i do not give a fuck about political messages and how deep the lyrics are. i would go as far as saying that i do not really care about what the lyrics mean as long as they sound good probably because english is not my language or maybe because i am an idiot. anyway this brings me to the fact that i find kendricks rapping pretty underwhelming i do not like his voice to much and his delivery is not really dynamic. also all those fakeweird voices he uses all along the album i do find rather grating for sale is the most obvious one but it is all over the record. in the end my main problem is how hit and miss it is not even from track to track but inside the tracks themselves. one second i feel like there is something really cool brewing up and the next one there is an annoying weird voice bit or a bitch talking about bald ass niggers or that song ruining featuring in the blacker the berry. oh and that fucking poem cut it off already. it is fun how negative this review sounds when i actually enjoyed the album a fair bit. king kunta and i are wonderful. but there is so much that keeps me from calling it a masterpiece or a classic. and then there will be people saying that i do not get it because i am a middle class white twenty something and i am pretty sure they would be right.,0
i think i can now say this with confidence. kendrick is just not the mc for me. if you collaborate with flying lotusthundercat two of my favorite musicians currently working and i only kind of like your new album i am not sure what else you can do to impress me. i suppose i should explain what i did like about this. first off flylo and thunder are all. over. this. it is really cool to hear them working with an mc extensively over this project. the three of them along with some sessions musicians work as a really cohesive unit. and that is the type of cohesion i thought good kid maad city sorely lacked. this project also contributes to a change in sound for kendrick which is a major improvement for him. i enjoyed that this does not sound like a straight forward hip-hop album but is rather reminiscent to the soulful funkadelic experimental albums that were seemingly all the rage in the early 00s. there is also a lack of radio singles aside from the two that were released prior to this album. it is a pretty bold move from one of the most popular rappers in the game. in fact the sound on this album flies in the face of pretty much the rest of hip-hop. these walls and how much a dollar cost sets an incredibly high watermark for others to achieve. but ultimately it is this very sound that forces kendrick to take a backseat on his very own album. my mind pretty much zoned out during those poetic interludes and do not get me started on that gimmicky 2pac interview. i was so impressed by the production here that at the end of the day it does not matter which rapper jumps on this. as much as i would like to hear more tracks in this vein ironically he is not the selling point. so despite the ambition and scope shown here kendrick still does not do anything for me.,0
perhaps i gravitate toward the axiom the simpler the better in my rejection of this highly regarded album. a celebration of jazz its offshoot synth funk thru the oral cinematography made popular by prince paul. ke ndrick uses a very highly stylized vocal rap reminiscent of rammellzee later popularized by flavor flav. throw in a quasimoto reference if you want as well this is fine. a jamboree of sound often unconcerned with melody. too busy for nuance. sweet syrup draped in coarse pointed hydraulics for a statement that is not abundantly clear. perhaps a riddle hidden amongst its theatrical complexity with clues lying in its historical references. it is certainly easy to miss amongst the abstract outbursts of emotion and syncopated energy. maybe this is the greatest showman of rap. polish pizzazz and rotating cast of characters who quickly disseminate behind the curtains. dsemnshn kendrick knowing damn well that we the people want to see what is forbidden. the fringe. a world beyond our own. an unapologetic statment of blackness. there is plenty to enjoy and become fixated on. the layers of sound contain lovely musicianship. harmonies. juxtaposed transfusions of sounds that do not often coagulate in the vessels of the mainstream. kendrick is confident in his raps and he flexes like the archetypal showman james brown marvel at his confidence his audacity to break down the fourth wall thru a spoken word narrative that carries over from one song to the next unconcerned with the sanctity of the other. but despite its overwhelming strengths the poverty lies in its lack of identifiable songs. which is perfectly fine for many a genre of music. but not justifiable here. be avant garde or pop. but do not try to be both. this is aquemini without the payoff. a period piece that gets caught up in its sources and bibliographical references. but even in this artistic pursuit kendrick rattles the cage by sandblasting the vocals into a relegated stratosphere of consciousness so that the idolatry becomes intolerable. never more exemplified than on for free? interlude - boo boo. a grand operatic that hails itself as the victor much like an oscar winning movie made to win an oscar. this is what happens when an mc ego does not get satisfied and curtails the very essence itself. i cannot deny the highlights dollarsthese wallscomplexion and the many bits  pieces of voluptuous sculpted stylings and cacophonies that illuminate this colorfully illustrated work on a whole. i would just rather wade into the source material and its wealth. music that truly was revolutionary and uncompromising. music that was dismissed by a nation gripped by the insidious nature of institutionalized apartheid. but whose water downed themes are finally digestable to a generation today.,0

casting aside contemporary hip hop influences in favor of civil rights movement-era black music foundations why the marriage is not more common is as much a mystery as why they still make banana runts. lamar has hereby received the torch from likely idol gil scott-heron to pen the spiritual soundtrack to the tumultuous black lives matter era of the american sociopolitical climate. and if this is when we truly begin to fall at least the score to national suicide is fitting---our darling poet kendrick a child born out of very real domestic oppression breathes fire over the corpse of this failed grand experiment.,0
yea kendrick.. sorry guys but i do not think he is as good as you guys make him to be. perhaps this is because i place a stronger importance on the actual rapping and beats over any message but it just fails to hit me on a deeper level. its a good album no doubt but much like its previous i feel that i am really missing out what makes this one so great particular in an era which has released some of my favourite hip hop albums. beatwise its much less commercial and brings a whole lot of jazz and funk beats that would have fitted in the 90s. the beats are definitly the better part of the album. they are perhaps a bit too mellow for the theme of the album but on their own they really provided a great groove. nice rnb hooks here and there as well. the rapping on the other hand is by far the weakest element. i simply do not like his style of rapping in particular when he tries to impersonate other people. its a concept that works out really well if done properly but here i found it to be silly more often than not. his fast rhymes come out flat to me even if some of his lyrics are great when you pay attention to them when shit hits the fan are you still a fan? standsout as one of the strongest. for free though is one of those songs that i cannot see either than being pure shit. hood politics is also pretty annoying. the rest of the release namely the album cover spoken poetry and the interview with 2pac show the huge amount of effort and creativity placed into this album. kendrick lamar surely does not lack ambition. but whatever it is he surely is missing out a vital element for me. something freddie gibbs killer mike and cunninlynguistics have by the loads. its not simply a matter of enjoying slower paced hip hop as i enjoy gangstarr and other like them a lot. overal a very solid album but does not live to the hype for me. standouts are wesleys theory king kunta these walls the blacker the berry and i.,0
in summary kendrick thinks a lot about things. the current state of hip-hop his role of life in compton and comptons role of life in him life after fame racial tensions in the you.s. post-ferguson just to name a few. the problem is kendrick does not seem to be draw any insightful or original thoughts about any of these topics. as such kendrick is at his best when he is simply trying to speak his heart rather than preach his mind.,0
kendrick lamar is an artist who has been able to break into the mainstream in the same way that eminem did he releases challenging emotionally charged albums. whereas eminem was more offensive thus making his message a little harder to decipher without careful listening lamar is challenging in a different way. the difficulty for to pimp a butterfly and the reason why it is necessary to listen to it a few times is that it is conceptually daring. instead of going down the same road as his previous album the critically acclaimed and beloved good kid m.a.a.d city lamar has embraced jazz funk and neo-soul. free jazz is known for utilizing constant chord changes and the chaotic nature is an effort to return jazz to its more primal form. it was a movement developed due to anger towards where conventional jazz has gone and to pimp a butterfly -- which is a terrible title but do not be fooled by it -- has more than one thing in common with that genre. the most obvious similarity that it has with jazz is the fact that it relies heavily on it. generally the instrument work behind lamar is the most interesting part of the album. it shifts and organically moves heavy on saxophone and experimentation. it is very rewarding when a jazzy beat slowly creeps into the music and compliments his words perfectly. it is not limited to jazz because there are times when a more upbeat and probably more radio-friendly beat will kick in. some of this is married with neo-soul guitar and these songs are the closest to being singles because most of the album is not set up for mass consumption. in all honesty this could have been released as a strictly-instrumental album and would have succeeded admirably. it is obvious that lamar is more conscious of concepts than most rappers working today because to pimp a butterfly is an example of a record that lives and dies by it. this is not merely a collection of songs as most of them bleed into one another and there is a clear motif here. the way the sound traverses from genre to genre also reeks of free jazz because he is not interested in making a rap album that sounds like every other one. it is not always easy to get into it but it can be immensely fulfilling once you have. he sometimes repeats lines such as a spoken word section that creeps its way in at the end of multiple songs slowly unfolding to tell a full story. i am not always a fan of this particular element because it feels unnecessary to get his point across. it can sometimes kill the momentum going into the next song when i hear a bunch of lines that i have already heard multiple times. they are poetic incredibly personal and good by themselves but repetition kills the meaning. this culminates in a final twelve minute track mortal man that sounds like a normal song until the final half -- then it brings tupac back from the dead in an interview between teacher and student lamar asking him questions and using samples to answer them. this is a a controversial decision not in a shocking way but because some people think it is perfect and others -- like me -- think it is a little cheesy. when i heard that it existed i was eager to listen but it left me cold. it is just a novelty but it does fit within the confides of the concept running through the album. i am glad i did not write a review after my initial listen though because i felt like there was too much spoken word. it can be used to enhance an experience but overindulgence in it can kill the pace of an album. it is one thing to have a record that is entirely spoken word then it is another to give listeners one thing only to take it away. they become parts that i would cut out once it is ripped to my computer. luckily on repeated listens i realized that it does not suffocate the album. sometimes they do as intended but other times they do not. this is an angry record. it is overtly personal this time around but he also takes aim at social injustices. he is deeply affected by police brutality and the plights of his people. it is never hard to understand what he is saying but it does it with a complexity that never obscures the message. he is a very talented mc and a man who can go from more simplistic rhymes to multis in an instant. he invokes and deals with his demons using a variety of voices. this results in his message usually being intensified but occasionally it holds it back. many have complimented you for him sobbing throughout but it just feels forced to me. other times it is absolutely a positive thing. take for free? interlude for example it is a song that his voice gets steadily higher at the end as he spits some of his most inspired stuff over a really delicious jazz freakout. i am a big proponent of mcs who do not say lines with the same boring bland delivery. lamar does it well for the most part but there are just a few moments where it becomes too much. still i would rather he do that and fail than be just another rapper. at the very least songs stick out in that regard. i do not feel the same love for to pimp a butterfly as i am seeing from most people around the internet but i think lamar is an artist we need in the public conscious. my problem with him particularly on this album is that he sometimes overstuffs the concepts. this leads to some weird creative urges that he ends up following to his detriment. if these inferior sections were small that would be great but this can lead to a good ten or fifteen minutes of music that should not be there. even so the other hour of music is an intelligent example of a genre that at least in the mainstream is criminally dishonoured by uninspired crap.,0
kendricks arty tendencies work better in his production choices and flows than in poetry or avant structures. his al tv style interview with tupac is an absurd trifle.,0
the revolution will be televised and brought to you by reebok.,0

a completely pedestrian work. the groundwork is bland melodies that no one could make appear anything but amateurish thus shields  co. decided to cleverly hide them amidst loud and irritating drone some cardboard drums and vocalists so bad i seriously cannot fathom why anyone ever thought it was a good idea to record them. now i obviously do not oppose the concept itself given my well-established love for the jesus  mary chain but i feel there is a fundamental difference between the bands while jamc worked noise into songs taking ear-piercing white noise as something to work with harmonically mbv layer chunks of coarse not-quite-so-white noise over their subpar britpop trifles of songs. the result is not hypnotising haunting dreamy or whatever vague adjective you choose to apply to me it all sounds rather morose. the work of a band who dabbled in pop music and understandably decided it was not their forte choosing to expand their half-formed songs to crude noisy jams that certainly do not sound like quarter a million pounds was spent on them. it is lifeless anemic and essentially boring.,0
as a very regular user of rym loveless became more and more difficult to avoid. an album released in 1991 and in the top fifty albums of all-time? well i just had to discover listen and review. there are many very highly rated albums which i enjoy but i do not understand quite why the adulation is so intense see for example kid a and spirit of eden. and i am now adding loveless to this list. perhaps the sound and style of this album was influential let us agree that the grinding guitars are cool and well backed by understated percussion and keyboards. but there are no words to enjoy the vocals are very restrained and for me this is a collection of cool riffs and sounds rather than something to thrill. yes yes yes i am probably completely missing the point but from an entertainment point of view my best offer is 3.5. key track when you sleep,0
music that people who are in the transition phase from emo to hipster listen to. that being said i actually like this album. it is messed up in a beautiful way. if that makes any sense. which it does not.,0
while there are many loose precedents for the dreamy langorous lysergic sweet fuzzy warbly sound on this album from the 60s sounds of mandrake memorial to the 80s sounds of sonic youth it is a great achievement of innovation with guitar timbre and texture a thick yet watery and fractured sound. combined with warm melodies and easy-going grooves these complex textures give great comfort and joy to the people who got hooked on this sound during their tender years. while i am not really a big fan of this 90s shoegaze sound i find it quite enjoyable and i can hear how it lives up to its titanic reputation actually ranked 18 of all-time on rym curiously far ahead of any soft machine fairport convention or you.s. maple album.,0
music is pretty much like the album cover generic crap with layers of effects to hide the weaknesses but they manage to hide it very well and turn it into feel good inoffensive but quite monotonous background music. enjoyable in fairly small doses but forgettable.,0
i figure that i should do myself a favour and listen to as many of ryms top rated albums as possible. so without knowing much about this at all i took the decision to listen to loveless. usually i will listen to an album at least 3 times before i review it. for this one i will make an exception because honestly i really could not be bothered to listen more than once. i have read the reviews positive and negative. it is fuzzy and swirling and maybe a bit hypnotic. there is also a lot of repetitive noise. there is no rhythm or melody. maybe it would sound good if i was on some drug induced high but that is not going to happen and this is therefore just a pointless waste of my time. it is staggering how many people think this is a masterpiece. i must be crazy for not agreeing right? well i am pretty sure i am not the crazy one!,0
see i can see the quality and the emotional power this album has really is deserving of all the accolades it is had. it is really fucking good. but it is not my album yknow? it never said that much at all to me. also can we talk about how silly everyone in this band had such silly names? they did!,0
bumped from january 21 2011 so i am standing here next to one of the most highly acclaimed indie albums of all time and ask why? and like a self-righteous celebrity built on ego you just push me to the side. you have many fans mr. celebrity and they like you but it is as if you do not like them back. numerous reviews of people rating 5 stars and just saying one-liners though in their defense the negative reviews are hardly any better... well i sir need to stand to you on that. okay you developed a sound consisting of a fuzz wall of armor but submerged within the layers brims with a neon luminescent aquatic life... or so they say. so i am on only shallow and a mechanical array baffles you before opening its doors to its true melodies awhile before it is walls close it to give it its true shoegaze prowess. going in deeper and deeper into the album it is all you are going to get from you. slow to mid tempos relying on a subtle noise and concealing a melody inside. this all goes on and i emphasize this with very little differentiation that is often the key to helping reignite some spark on albums that drift away from my attention. now many people do not get this album from only the bombardment standpoint of the unfriendly to some wall of sound. now the wall of sound is okay i get that it is part of the art but the problem here is that its just been done better after-time or before. bridging my review is this summary walls of sound do not annoy me but this album bothers me from the outside and in the inside. of course people might ask you to look underneath but even then the melodies excavated from these layers just are 100 drab forgettable and a wandering waste of my time get bored my back hurts and whatever grumpy old man thing i can think of from this 20 year old brain. and it does not help being atmospheric either because that is where the wall of sound takes such a thing away. it is between a rock and a hard place too calm to be driven by it and too obstructing to be soothing. let me put it to you this way you eat a chocolate bar and it tastes unappealing. just as you are about to throw it away some person comes up and tells you that there is a creamy irresistible nougat in the center. so of curiosity you get to bite the center only to discover that the nougat is also unappealing. that sums up what loveless is to me unappealing hiding inside more unappealing. you probably need weed to enjoy this to summarize but true music is let loose without the aid of skeptical alterations. i do not hate shoegaze in its entity and i might not like chapterhouse so much either but the reason i still prefer them is that they can actually write appealing melodies from time to time and does not sound like they are bored out of their skulls while maintaining a shoegaze sound. such an overrated album really probably the most overrated album i ever listened to but what can you expect that the big-dicked critics like pitchfork must lay down the hammer that this is perfect music and everyone must insist on investing into those words. i am not trying to make this a when everyone goes left i go right case but it frustrates me how critics can have such control over music. 4.710 ---poor,0

there must be some secret way to enjoy this album that i have not been let in on. to the nake eye it is just a bunch of droning noises that do not even sound that great and do not change the least bit for often at least a minute. as for the vocals they sound nice but they do not change notes and can barely been heard. one of the biggest letdowns i have ever experienced. edit listened to it again to give it a second chance becuase of thier new album and i actually liked some of the songs especially the last song. there were a couple of songs i did not like though to be honest. i guess shoegaze is not my thing,0
     -   3.0. upd      .   .,0
the whole wall of sound is pretty chintzy and trebly. the guitars are not too noisy and the rhythm section is amateurish and the vocals trifling. despite some decent guitar tones it is terribly dull.,0
loveless produces a sound just as fuzzy as the cover and in the process creates a very good album that is deserving of some praise but not the amount rym has given it. the sound and production is revolutionary and after sorting through the fuzz there is some brilliant work being done on the production end that justifies the year long recording periord. i would give this album a higher rating if some tracks were tighter and did not repeat a loop of sound for the last minute of the track. the most notorious offenders are i only said and to here knows when which were they shorter would add another half star. unlike most reviewers trying to poke holes in loveless i do not mind the vocal quality and find it soothing and do not get hung up on whether or not i can discern the lyrics. after giving it several listens i feel as though loveless is the sort of album that you need to hear at the right time and place in your life to be blown away by it. even taking it out of the aforementioned scenario loveless is an intriguing amusing but short of enthralling record that is worth a listen if only for its unique sound. favorites only shallow loomer sometimes,0
loveless is pleasant. loveless is ground-breaking. loveless is overrated.,0
trying to make out the details behind this loud fucking noise-core.,0
ouch! approved with the headphonical seal of utter crap torture soundscapes,0
am i the only one on this site with enough balls to admit that i just do not get this? people hail this as amazing yet all i hear are some pleasant fuzzy melodies layered in a thick coating of warm noise. sure this is not bad at all quite nice actually but is it worthy of being at this point in time the 28th best record of all time? hell no. more often than not this album gets both annoying and boring although there are many decent enough moments to make up for it. most of the songs blend into each other except for sometimes which is a song i want to make sweet sweet sweet love to. sonically. look if you want to read a negative review then go to the negative reviews section and if you want to hear a positive review then go to the positive reviews section. this review cannot say anything that has not been said about this album before besides from the fact that it is all just somewhat pleasant noise. all you hipsters should stop fucking fooling everyone and yourselves and just admit that you do not really get this album and the only reason you pretend that you do is because it makes you trendy. there i said what was needed to be said.,0
pointless,0
i will get the highlights out of the way now... these are essentially the least god-awful songs on the cd when you sleep sometimes loveless essentially amounts to the emperors new clothes of all music. there is not a single good piece of music on the entire record yet it sucks orgasms out of disillusioned listeners like some coked-out anna nicole smith at a glory hole. how this degenerate piece of garbage acheived such fanboy status in the first place is inexplicable it is only certain that the illusion by mere existence perpetuates itself. loveless was supposed to be one of the defining albums of the 90s the quintessential shoegaze album if you will. in attempting to listen to it though it is hard for any serious music lover not to resort to ad hominem attacks at the sheer pointlessness of it or on the other hand discard it entirely. in that light i am guessing that if more listeners were of the former category it would have a far lower rating. but enough about the hype. on to the music. to start off the vocals are overwhelmed by talentless scarcely melodic cacophonous noises without even minimal percussion cement it all together i know i get it it is supposed to be minimalistic right? the reason for the inaudible vocals is because if one could actually here the lyrics being sung then one would realize how unbelievably bad and thoughtless the lyrics actually are. prepubescent wannabe poet being cruelly encouraged by his instructors to continue the therapeutic writing even though it is complete shit and everyone knows it. then there are the horrible horribe sounds. i think some of them are guitars but it is hard to tell they are all muddled together in one massive heap. well there is not much past the sounds. that is pretty much what this album is regardless of whether you want to add a lyrical spin to it or not. unique in this instance is a bad thing. just because you can do something does not mean you should. i could record myself taking a piss the floor for instance but it would be a waste of my time and everyone elses. that all being said do yourself a favor and do not listen to this crap. and if you do have the decency to call it like it is a piss-dripping mangled and dangling dick with nothing to cover it up.,0
 !            . ?      . ? !,0
concept album. about foot pedals and such.,0
well what can i say? i have a funny feeling that this album would probably sound pretty good if you would ingested some mushroom soup before hand and i am not talkin heinz variety here do not get me wrong i have taken plenty of trips myself and much farther than brighton i can tell you but in the cold light of day i am afraid this one really is hard work to listen to. so for now at least it receives the lowest mark in my collection. maybe one day i will dust it down and give it another go but with so much other stuff out there vying for my attention and screaming to be listened to i doubt whether this albums second chance will come any time soon.,0
you know there is nothing more boring than some dick on the internet giving a low rating to a much loved classic album and writing a long overwrought review explaining how he is right dammit and all you all sheeple are dead wrong. i would rather read through all the 0.5 star reviews of 808s and heartbreak lol south park quote fagot than do one of those. plus i already kind of did that for 3 feet high and rising. but this album i just do not get. i am not trying to make some kind of point - i just find it disappointing considering it is meant to be pet soundz for the 90s yo! and such. i dug their previous cd it is got some awesome tunes on it and a nice dreamy overall quality. this one though has a dreamy sick quality without any of the awesome tunes. i do not know. i guess i just do not have the right appreciation for noise as a genre. i will stick with with their first album. i do encourage everyone to check it out because as much as i dislike it i somehow doubt i will ever hear another album quite like it.,0
not a bad album but hardly the earth-shattering experience that many claim it to be. not much in the way of songwriting and the execution is fairly pedestrian. it does succeed in establishing a decent atmospheric feel but that is not enough to make this otherwise somewhat amateurish album anything special.,0
after initial hearings i gave this noise classic 1 12 stars assuming its genius would later dawn on me. instead i found it was giving my other 1 12s a bad name so i took it out of the homeless shelter and handed it back to the department of corrections.,0
bloody awful. actually there is a good album beneath all the horrific droning. if i had some sort of audio editing software on my computer i could probably cobble together a nice 4 star album out of this. however as it stands this is perhaps the most annoying album i have ever heard. it sounds like it was recorded inside a beehive. do not play this album if you have a dog it will be pure torture for the poor creature. along with the stone roses it is a late 80searly 90s british release generally considered brilliant which just makes me wonder what the hell other people are hearing.,0
i have no problems at all with loveless no problems with people who lavish praise on it. but there are songs that rise above songs that because me problems when people say this whole album is perfect. well thee first n last tracks because more of a mental stir no matter how layered thee middle 9 are. only shallow has that buried riff which is also instantly memorable. my first time hearing this ditty is it ok to call an art-song like this a ditty? was probably just like thee first time so many devotees heard it but it was intense anyhow. agreeable n slicing it deserves to be played at each volume setting on yr stereo to reveal thee full range that is shoegazers mastery.  soon well that song is what i compare all other lengthy noise pop songs to. it contains that emergence from lo-fi dance drums into a fuzz rock spectacle with hallucination inducing background vocals.  more of course. this runs deep.,0
pretty music but there is not a whole lot here.,0
picked this up after reading all the glowing reviews on this site. this is noise pop. and dreary noise pop too. i prefer music. if you want to immerse yourself in immelodious noise driven by overloud droning guitars accompanied by feedback and barely audible vocals then enjoy!. occasionally a jolly little hook surfaces momentarily to be swallowed up by the sea of noise. i have listened to this repeatedly over several months and i still cannot find any high points to be positive about. sometimes is probably the most listenable track. it is not one that will be getting much play time in my life.,0
i once owed this album.i think it was the first song or second on the record that i liked that prompted me to pay cash for the album in hopes of joyful noise.then i played the other songs and carefully listened.i took the record off.i played it about two months later.i looked at my feet.i put my feet in motion.i went to the record store that gave me money for used records.i exchanged it for cash.i then went taco casa and bought me a burrito boat.yummmmmcheese and beef.,0
do you ever feel like you have picked up a different album to the one everybody else has? gang of fours entertainment! the pixies doolittle jamcs psychocandy and this album are all releases that get praised to the heavens. all of them have been recommended to me by people who is opinions i respect some of whom are almost as intelligent as myself. all of them turned out to be faintly boring. what gives? we all know electric guitars can be exciting dynamic instruments. most of us know just how cool feedback can be some of us love the visceral thrill of a noise overload. this album has layers of guitar noise feedback echoing throughout with glorious lush melodies and pop sensibilities underneath. or so the official line goes. on the cd i picked up there is a rather dull droning noise like someone doing their vacuum cleaning in an echo chamber. that dull turgid drone continues throughout the album. the lush melodies underneath turn out to be the cranberries pissing about with a bunch of demos the cocteau twins threw away in disgust. honestly this record is typical nme approved dull indie rock with a meandering drone played over the top. it is about as original as the next oasis album and as exciting as a heavy stereo comeback tour. it is not awful it is just kind of there in the same way that traffic noise is there. you just would not rate it 5 stars.,0
possibly the most annoying record i have ever heard. the dissonant wall of sound and sickly sweet vocals just does not do it for me. nowhere are any progressions to be found in the music - only repetitive chords banging over and over chords filtered through so much noise and fuzz that extended listening induces migraines. little wonder then that robert christgau was all over this album but even then he admits that he hated it at first but it was only after suitable suffering and peer support i learned. yep kind of indicates that this is just hipster bullshit. as far as shoegaze goes while these bands are not pure shoegaze give me the smashing pumpkins anyday over this tripe or even the silversun pickups album from a couple years back - at least they have decent melodies and good drumming none of this drum loop and sample rubbish. and what is more i am sure virtually every hipster here would praise the juxtaposition of ugly dissonace and nice melodies of this record saying that it is a one of a kind record and at the same time dismiss other music styles such as death metal which does the whole beautiful but punishing thing a million times better. but whatever ignorance is bliss right? unrated  0100,0
i never saw mbv back in my formative years even though many of my old friends went at least partially deaf at their shows. as far as pioneering shoegazers go i much prefer lush. i can appreciate this album for the atmosphere it creates and its production values but it is so obvious mbv want to be a pop band. if they would written more stuff like to here knows when their rep would be more deserving but they stuck to form rather than content. anyway noise - melodic dissonant whatever - was hardly a new concept in 1991. thing is they do not write any other fully formed noteworthy tunes despite kevin shields fucking around with his pedals most of the time. i do not really understand the gushing accolades this receives.,0
it is good not thaaaaat good though. not wanting to get all controversial or owt but nowt as great as you made me realise. oooooh it came out on my birthday. i bought it on the day and was possibly drunk i would imagine....what with it being my birthday. not the infamous ace of spades birthday of 89. never been the same since you know!,0
more than anything else i have heard loveless works as a complete album rather than a random collection of songs. in other words it has a fantastic flow. the album starts with only shallow which is not noisey so much as it is fuzzy. it is got an electric hook that the whole band mimics. it is hard to describe just how together it sounds but it sounds like the look of a very unified rapid i.e. a roaring river that flows up and down and over little waterfalls all in one direction. cutting through this river is are the super compressed drums which provide fills that sound more like something is going off than being hit. interestingly only shallow is the only song that has that level of impact. loomer and touched are forgettable. to here knows when is just noise ambient. it is alright. loveless only slightly recovers on when you sleep with its dreamy lead synth hook it almost sounds like a gentle organ which shows up at times. i only said has a similarly tasty hook but it is a bit noisier. here more than anywhere else on loveless or is not anything the lyrics are utterly unintelligible. the vocals are just a melody instrument. then things get back to more ambient fuzz again before what you want provides the albums first noisey-as-in-a-little-painful sound making it the first track that does not simply work as a good atmosphere piece. i cannot help but with that this track came after come in alone because after 8 tracks the harshness of what you want is a little much for my fatigued ears. besides this one gripe the album flows miraculously with the songs going from hook-y to atmospheric to hook-y and then back to atmospheric. it is a kind of dynamic that albums rarely work with and so even if few songs are outstanding the whole thing comes together for a pretty good experience.,0
         .              !,0
espetacular,0
so much noise i cannot even hear them sing over all the instruments and if i can hear them its harder to understand than a 2-year-old kid then only good track is when you sleep because of the riff on it maybe i need to wait 5 more years until i can really understand or maybe it is too deep for me right now like i really do not get it so in 5 years i might come back,0
i have never been able to appreciate this album. despite it is status as the greatest shoegaze album of all time i would much rather give that accolade to you know what- glitter by pasteboard that is right. why the shocked face? oh i suppose souvlaki deserves an honorable mention. loveless is an album with a bit too much noise pop and not enough dream pop in my humble opinion. it actually wears on my ears after a fashion- this coming from someone who enjoys raw black metal. the guitar tone is beyond mere fuzzy sometimes it sounds like churning gravel for gods sake. now we need to discuss the whining reverb i cannot help but wince every time the reverb hits a peak. sometimes is a great song other than that i do not know what to tell you.,0
loveless is an album with a heavyweight reputation behind it so much so that i must admit i have spent the last two decades being both intrigued and wary of it. it is an album whose place in the grand scheme of influential rock albums is assured regardless of it being a cult favourite rather than a best seller. it is one of those albums appreciated by those who take their music very seriously. perhaps a little too seriously. loveless is an album that took the band who created it over two decades to follow up simply because it was almost impossible to top. the more i listen to loveless the more i realise that it is an album you listen to for how it makes you feel rather than the actual songs and how it makes you feel is as unique as the individual listening to it. for example the first time i listened to loveless in full was when i was going for a walk on the first day of starting a new job so it made me fell warm slightly buzzing full of trepidation but undeniably excited. now i am pretty sure that is not the emotional headspace that my bloody valentine had in mind when they were creating loveless but every time i listen to it it gives me those same feelings. musically yeah loveless is what i was anticipating. lots of distorted guitars and a genuine feeling of distance and space. now i would usually grumble about a vocals being buried far too deep in the mix but bilinda butchers vocals are exactly where they need to be in fact the whole sound of the album is something i could only describe is meticulously organised chaos which now i have done a bit of research into the agonising lengths that band went into creating loveless may not be too far from the mark. i say band but there is various claims that kevin shields played every note of music himself with butcher handling the vocals and an immense amount time was spent trying to master the studio technology and switching around various engineers to get the exact sound that shields wanted. apparently such efforts almost bankrupted their record label. perhaps inevitably loveless is an album i need to be in the mood for and while i am not in that mood very often when i am it is the only album i reach for. it was the unarguable apex of the arty shoegaze sound and carries with it the sort of cool cachet that means it is an album that subsequent generations will gravitate to in much the same way as they gravitate to the velvet underground  nico or forever changes so it seems that its reputation among those who take their music seriously is unlikely to dwindle at any point in the foreseeable future.,0
do not get me wrong i still really like most of what loveless has to offer but it is definitely not the holy grail end all be all shoegaze album that 99 of people on this site say it is. compared to similar albums such as slowdives souvlaki i find the songwriting and general instrumentation of loveless to be inferior. while i would consider this to be a great listen it is a little annoying that a few of the songs are not mixed as well as the others. especially to here knows when as the guitar and vocals completely overpower the drums. do not even get me started on touched. it is such a stupid sounding song that serves no purpose to the album but to be skipped over every time. i wonder what kind of drugs colm ociosoig was on when he made it. while this is far from being a perfect and flawless album it redeems itself by having a handful of great and enjoyable tracks.,0
just plain old noisy and dreamy pink is my fave color does not understand the concept of sex but gets sex anyway happy but also in pain absolutely celebrated loveless. okay fine i do not hate it that much i am more with the crowd that says that it is a fine piece of shoegaze... but as a seminal album in all points maybe??? what clicks to most people is that the whole sound of the record is that it is ethereal and soothing but i picture it as... just noise i do not know. it is hard trying to sum up words for albums you just think are in a spot of being good but could not fully get what the hype is all about but i had to make due to listen to it because i knew there was some fruition with it. i could vibe with a band that uses the whammy bar a bit more if they made that could be comprehensive to my psyche then again that would sound better or worse depending on many things if you think that this albums chaos is already enough but long story short i just think that it is alright. i am not dissing anybody who likes this or the shoegaze crowd in general i just think that this is good for what it stands for and i can understand what it is aiming... i just.... reaallly had a tough time putting it all together.,0
take some mediocre songwriting and throw a bunch of effects over this music and you get something that sounds like this. i do not really see the appeal of this album other than maybe the vibe it gives off.,0
i never used to like this album. i do not really like any of the shoegaze classics. but last night i was rewatching lost in translation with my girlfriend and in this one scene a song was playing that we both thought was cool so we shazamed it. the song was sometimes and i was kind of shocked because i did not remember enjoying any other track off of this album apart from when you sleep but this one sounded really cool and it made me want to go back and give the album another go. and going back to loveless i was even more shocked to find that i actually like it. during the first four tracks i was dreading that it was going to suck just as much as it did the first few times around but then once you get to when you sleep the rest of the album is really enjoyable. still nowhere near as good as most make it out to be but i am learning to appreciate loveless more and more. maybe one day i will be able to say that i love it.,0
alright so straight out of the bat this album makes my head hurt like crazy. i had to take a break at the halfway point. track ratings 1. only shallow 9.510 - easily the best song on here. the intro is the best part of the album i just love the way it comes in so loudly. the vocals are very fitting to the song. 2. loomer 510 - a very boring filler song. the vocals are very annoying and guitar is way too messy. 3. touched 310 - i know it is under a minute long but it really gets under my skin. it is just so obnoxious. 4. to here knows when 110 - what the fuck is this? sounds like a very shitty demo recorded on a old nokia that has just been taken out of water. 5. when you sleep 910 - a fantastic song that was obviously intended to be a hit. gorgeous riff and vocals. 6. i only said 710 - the guitar is obviously great so is the synth melody but i do not like the vocals at all. also this song gave me the biggest headache. 7. come in alone 7.510 - great riff decent vocals - nothing more to say. 8. sometimes 8.510 - this ones very good. the way the acoustic and electric guitar collide with eachother is phenomenal. 9. blown a wish 6.510 - wasted potential. the beginning melody is very pleasant but sadly the vocals completely ruin it. the chorus i do not know if you can call it that is extremely annoying. 10. what you want 7.510 - i would give this one an 8 if it was a minute and a half shorter take a minute off the actual songa nd 30 seconds of the outro. nothing else to pick on though. 11. soon 910 - very suprised with how much i liked this one. very catchy melody and it is probably the most calm song on here. vocals are passable which is good enough for mbv. score 6.710 final verdict had potential to be better than it is. some songs are the peak of 90s alternative rock music other are just boring and sometimes even unlistenable to here knows when. the most criminal thing however is the production. it is no exacuration fucking abysmal. the drums are hard to hear in over half of the tracks which is a shame because it could easily bump up the some ratings only shallow would be a 10. also where is the bass? i do see the appeal of this record but guys come on. 6 album of all time???,0
i already listened to loveless once but i remember absolutely nothing about it. so today i decided to relisten which i did not even have the urge to do and it did not change my mind on anything. its not like this album is bad or anything but it is not anything memorable for me. there is way too many god damn effects on everything that i cannot hear what is going on. that also brings me to my 2nd problem with the album is that everything feels sluggish leading the album to feel twice as long as it already is. again the album is bad and i even like some aspects of this but as an overall experience it does nothing for me. i garuntee you that i am going to forget most of this album when i am done listening,0
another case of i do not get it. yknow whenever i listen to something that critically acclaimed and then really do not like it i feel kind of stupid and like i am missing out. well that is exactly what happened here. there are not really redeeming qualities about this album that would justify giving any higher rating for me and i am seriously baffled about how this got to the place it is in but i guess i can appreciate it for what it is. i can imagine having this in the background for whatever but overall it just seems uninteresting lyrically as much as sonically. i have heard worse but this just is not for me.,0
this album just does not click for me. it is clearly technically fantastic and sonically beautiful but it feels off like it is lacking soul. the faults i find in this album if any are not really faults but just a feeling  a lack of love that i think should be there. compared to souvlaki the other famous shoegaze album it does not achieve the same emotional poignancy or indeed the same emotional anything. the track touched came the closest with its trippy aesthetics sounding like part of a vaporwave record but being less than a minute long it was not enough. maybe i am missing something perhaps it is better while on drugs or on a car ride or perhaps live but right now i cannot sense the greatness. all things considered this album is truly awesome but i really wish it could evoke some sort of emotion. best tracks only shallow loomer touched to here knows when worst tracks come in alone sometimes,0
i like shoegaze so this is not an example of an album not being for me. simply put it is not a good album. although there is a couple of redeeming moments for the most part it is filled with uninteresting melodies that tire out after the first 20 seconds of the song or are simply just not good. 410,0
loveless would benefit immensely from heavier production a la red house painters down colourful hill strong 7 to a light 8,0
i listened to this album a few times and i can never get why this site adores this album. sure it has the merit of being one of the most influential albums ever recorded but it is not really my cup of tea. if they did not drown the vocals under the instruments i am sure i would like it much more but then it loses the thing that made it so unique. only shallow is my favorite song here and i can see why soon gets the reputation as one of the most revolutionary pop songs.,0
part 2 of dropping a lot of money on albums i am not a huge fan of. this time it is a pretty big one. i do not know if i should keep this brief or go off on a rant guess i will see. i will start by talking about it in relation to the previous album an album i thought was bad is not anything. this album is much more focused it uses the noisiness in a much more direct effective way. paired with that the vocals are actually on-key this time they do help in making that ethereal sound and feeling that these guys are known for. there is a lot more structure throughout and there is not too much here that feels amateurish there is genuinely good use of the heavy effects. i mean from the very first moment that is evident on only shallow with that infamous beginning the wall of noise that just slaps you in the face. from there you have loomer which is another track that i enjoy quite a lot. however it stops here. from here until soon there is not much i find interesting. all the ideas that this album has are pretty much expended by the end of the first two tracks. from the walls of noise heavier ethereal moments more vocals weird moments like the end of the first track it is all found in these first two tracks. so from here everything just became this one noise that was quite similar bouncing from one to the other feeling like nothing but the same. the transitions kind suck too like from touched to to here knows when it almost makes the interlude track feel totally redundant the way it is done so sloppily. the rest of the album follows suit treading this line of listenable yet boring if not because of a lack of ideas then because of a lack of emotion. i did enjoy soon quite a bit i found it to have a slightly more solid set of ideas that it managed to execute luckily there was at least that. again as i said for the previous album it feels as if the noise is being used as a means to cover something up except this time it is not lack of musical ability i think this time it is a lack of song writing ability. i struggle to believe an album like this almost caused bankruptcy. rating  5-5.510,0
. hello. my name is cold in eden and i want to write a review for my bloody valentines album loveless. i have never understood why this shit is so highly rated. shoegaze is fucking overrated post-punk is overrated and this shit is just plain stupid. i am going to start off by saying that the vocals are pretty good on here. the singer sounds like she could be in a band or something. however her voice does not really carry the song. it is not bad per say but it is not anything special either. also i do not understand why it is ranked  5 on the rateyourmusic site. what the fuck? that site is filled with shit and i do not even trust it. they have got radiohead at the 1 rank that is pretty fucking stupid considering how overrated that band is. wall of sound production on this thing is pretty damn stupid too. guitar tone 210. generic boring and very predictable. i can hear the same thing in every emo bands music after a while. the same tremolo picking is used for the rhythm parts too. rhythm 710. generic drumming pattern will not bore you and the bassist follows it pretty accurately most of the time. i do not like the fact that they always use a 74 time signature though. it is fucking cheesy. bass 810. good job. drums 510. generic as hell but they do the job. vocals 710. cannot really add anything else to this part. they are not bad and they fit the music well enough. my bloody valentine in my opinion could have done better. every single song on here could have been 3-4 minutes long and it would not have hurt anything. there really is nothing special here at all and it could have easily been a half hour long and still been shit. despite this i do find some things attractive about this album. it is raw but that is mainly appealing to people who enjoy bad production and amateur sounding stuff. the guitar tone is just horrible but that is not really something you can fix. as for the shoegaze elements they are there but i cannot say i am a fan of it. it is not bad enough to hate it though so there is that. overall 6.510 better than most releases but still pretty mediocre. i would say this is worth at least a few listens but after that it is not much more to it. thanks for reading.,0
this album is not good. the juxtaposition of sentimentality and harshness only meshes on a few songs such as to here knows when and maybe two other songs. good ideas do not mean good execution. this sounds like less noisy and interesting spacemen 3 for dumb teenagers who need to cling onto some messy half-baked form of nostalgic emotions. the music itself is not bad but it is not as innovative as people make it out to be. this is one of the few albums where its reputation hurts it as it sets up high expectations and then delivers mediocrity lowering it a star. unbias be damned.,0
bad mixing? i could not hear the vocals at all the instruments are too loud. it sounds like the guy hums random words through a loud so forward in the mix guitar that is effected so much. what does this mean? i have so many questions about this could this just be another album with a gimmick?,0
something that has always got me has been the claim that for anyone wanting to get into schoegaze music this is the album for it. it is labelled as a benchmark and even one of the best albums of the 90s. off the top of my head i can name 10 albums that dropped in 1991 alone that are better than this. atmospherics should not be the only factor when evaluating this record. like most people rightfully argue that the majority of edm is repetitive my bloody valentine has seriously committed this cardinal sin with this release. where the cloudiness comes in quite beautifully like on only shallow or when you sleep. both of which are blissful and euphoric in the best possible way. the rest of the album continues to get more and more cloudy throughout till you are left in a confusing and boring fog. loomer and sometimes are thick condensed shoegaze tracks that almost feel like attempts to recreate some tracks from the jesus and mary chains psychocandy. but with overbearing production and no direction. and touched if i may touch just briefly on it is a 56 second waste of breath. if you can keep your focus to the end of the album you will be treated to a rather spectacular end with the cut soon. at almost 7 minutes long it is hypnotic and winds what themes they were trying to incorporate together very well. loveless tricks you into thinking there is more there than there really is. the washed out guitars when taken away leave everything else very bare bones. i recommend you turn your attention the massively under-appreciated pale saints.,0
decent. when you sleep is an amazing song but the rest of the album is whatever. maybe i am just not a big fan of shoegaze or do not see the appeal. it is wayyy too long of an album for tracks that sound almost identical and would probably make you fall asleep and crash if you listened while driving.,0
i do not know if it is too late but i have always wanted to listen to the album because it is so praised. i am pretty new to the shoegaze direction but i really really like what i hear in loveless. the songs all have such a from far away effect i cannot put it into words but i hope you understand it to some extent. my favorite tracks were definitely blown a wish when you sleep and loomer. the whole album has a 60s-70s sound which i like a lot because i am a huge fan of this kind of music. in general i think it is really very good and really ahead of its time.,0
loveless really just feels that it is reaching for something it never grabs. it is hazy and distant vocals and atmospheric and rough production all seem to attempt to fully envelop the listener in the albums sound and emotion but it never truly works for me. it ends up feeling samey and repetitive instead of lush and exciting. i appreciate parts of its productions and can see the sound it aims for but all the elements of this album ultimately do not come together in my opinion. the vocals seem far too soft emotionless and distant. they blend pretty poorly with the more jagged and piercing production or feel buried by the more cloudy atmospheric production. they do not simply feel soft they feel lazy. despite the amount of work that went into the album most of it feels incredibly amateurish. like the idea to bury the vocals so deeply under the track feels like the failed decision of a newcomer hoping to distinguish themselves. its production like its vocals rarely ever feels emotive and feels incredibly bland and muted. the distortion fails to add any personality to the music and just makes it feel less distinct. it seems to try to capture some a cloudy and distorted sense of ethereality but just seems uninspired and weak. the guitars are the only elements i really get any enjoyment out of and that is when the album is straying furthest away from its sound. a soft grungy and atmospheric sound has been gracefully executed countless times and loveless seems so to try to replicate these sounds without any of the personality of its predecessors. it is a shame the sonics are so poorly handled as the lyrics are pretty effective at conveying themes of isolation and sadness. the lyrics are short but succinct yet they hardly seem to matter with the vocals so deemphasized. i may be misunderstanding the intent of the album but regardless of what sound emotion or idea it attempts to convey it fails to do so in my mind.,0
very gorgeous sound world. makes you feel like you are inhabiting candyfloss clouds. the mystery and i think a large part of the appeal of this album is how something so noisy can sound so pretty.,0
yeah overrated asf but still good. i see a lot of people call this peak music and all of them should be avoided at all cost this is good but not tiger by thaiboy digital.,0
for the longest time i have avoided reviewing and even talking about this album because i have never been truly able to express why it does not click for me. why such a landmark and universally acclaimed album in a genre i adore is just meh to me. i do not really like speaking negatively about albums especially albums that lots of people love nor do i like hearing people speak negatively about albums i love. songs sure but albums are a whole other ordeal. it is just who i am as a music fan. i guess that is why i am grateful for the go review game and more specifically insoluble77 for picking this album for me to review. it makes me face challenges with my music taste. enough whining it is time for me to explain my thoughts on this album. like i said it is difficult to explain why this album does not click for me. i will put it this way this album is one hazy psychedelic dream like practically no other album out there. even other shoegaze albums like to see the next part of the dream the texas-jerusalem crossroads or even is not anything do not compare to the immersive and kaleidoscopic atmosphere. for many people this dream is a life-changing utterly euphoric experience. it feels like nothing else in the world and they absolutely adore it. for me it is a mix of phenomenal uninteresting and grating. most times it is the latter two. the allure and singularity of the dream wear off quickly and all i am left with is just flashes of brilliance within a mix of aimless distortion. by the time i wake up from the dream i feel relieved that i am out of it yet at the same time i feel a certain level of respect for the dream and just how unique it was compared to most others i had. to put it in less metaphorical terms the songs on here mainly just sound noisy with no purpose. it leaves me wanting more which i get from other releases in the genre like the texas-jerusalem crossroads and night time my time. whereas those genres use the noise to support greater musical ideas and also to express the emotion that the artist is trying to convey the noise on loveless just sounds like my bloody valentine are trying to make the most unique alt rock album out there. where the album succeeds is when they focus on the songcraft. even i cannot deny the absolute perfection of only shallow or the killer chorus of when you sleep. the hazy erratic atmosphere actually works for me on to here knows when. however songs like loomer touched and blown a wish just bring the album down for me. it is a shame because if this album was as strong as its strongest songs it could have been one of my favorite albums of all time. as is it just does not work for me.,0
noise. noiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiise. i am sorry i do not care if i offend all the sweaty mulet us everything good in this album is obscured by a fucking avalanche of distortion and ambient sound that just kills it for me.,0
loveless is an album that everyone says is good but i just do not get it. yeah the shoegaze sounds nice however i cannot ever understand any of the vocals which may be the point of the music but its annoying to me.,0
jeg m konstatere at dette album kommer p listen over ekstremt hjt estimerede vrker som jeg simpelthen ikke kan se det store lys i - det er om muligt endnu mere stjet og dronet i smadder end forgngeren og jeg fr nrmest kvalme af at lytte til flere af numrene - de poppede when you sleep og i only said midtp skiller sig markant ud og er okay numre men derudover mest nej tak.,0
en passant jaime bien cet album certain vont trouver que cest un peu amateur comme groupe moi je crois que cest plutt le mix qui est assez moyen mais les chansons sont superbes du vrai shoegaze et du pure dream pop un re-mix serait essentiel quelquun comme steven wilson pourrait faire des miracles.,0
for the most part its enjoyable. love the super hazy noisy dream pop aesthetic that runs throughout here. not the biggest fan of the vocals however as they do not particularly layer well with some of the production i am going to. overall the record is a good vibe. personally though it feels just a bit too sleepy for my tastes. best tracks only shallow loomer touched when you sleep sometimes what you want,0
there is a special kind of talent - to make something work that does not seem to be able to work under any circumstances. this is a typical example. elephant guitars would be terrible everywhere but thanks to the support of bilindas soaring vocals they are redeemed and even manage to sound good - in contrast. it does not always work about a third of the album is terrible but it is still a great achievement.,0
albeit a classic and necessary component of contemporary underground rock canon for all it is critical merit loveless does not leave me in awe despite it is many accolades. let it not be misconstrued though i do love this album in my own way. i associate it more with my times of exploring more niche critically acclaimed bands or mu core if you will. not really any weak spots on the album that i can think of but the same sound all throughout can all feel like one really long song for the most part. perhaps that is what the dreamy noise of the album is trying to achieve though.,0
this was a drag of a listen. it was not bad but in a way it was worse than bad it was boring. ok let me explain. i did not dislike this album i can appreciate it for sure and i can see why people do like it but god this was annoying. a lot of this album does sound the same and that is coming from someone who loves drone music the issue here is it is all so uninteresting nothing ever jumped out to me i sat through the entire thing kind of waiting for something to happen nothing did of course and yes i have listened multiple times because i wanted to like this i wanted to love it even but god i just cannot let us dig into this then what do not i like? well there are two main factors the vocals and the noise. let us start with the vocals. the vocals are incredibly annoying to me this album sounds a lot better without them the only time they sound good is on sometimes and that is it the rest of the time they feel unnecessary and annoying i can understand the appeal to them but to me they kind of just got in the way of the enjoyment i know vocals are another instrument but this is an instrument this album could have done without. now i am no newcomer to quite high vocals beach house is a good example of a band who definitely take inspiration from mbv it is quite obvious but god they do it so much better. vocally this album grated me i really dislike these vocals and i doubt it is something i can look over in future listens. if i do come back to this. secondly the noise. i know the genre is noise pop so why am i complaining about this well. it is quite overbearing and again this is coming from someone who loves noise music the talkies ywgwyw xiu xiu. this just was not that it definitely fits the bill for noise but it felt a lot more merzbow than xiu xiu if you get what i mean. the sound of this album feels like if you inverted ywgwyw instead of being dark deep and battering it is quite high vibrant and positive. this album feels like heaven i do not mean that in a good way it feels like a light shining down on you into your eyes specifically. now there are definitely good points to this album some are very sparse and barely raise it up a point but i appreciate them then there are longer points like the ending to what you want or the entirety of sometimes there are points where i think maybe i should not rate this album so poorly but then they end and i am left with blinding lights. i will admit there were points to this where i was bobbing my head in enjoyment like on what you want i liked that song a lot as well as sometimes. i should probably explain why. sometimes sounded different to the other songs on here it was a lot calmer in sound and vocal performance the vocals are not overbearing and neither is the sound it feels contained and quite nice. this is the kind of sound i was expecting from this album not high synths screeching into my ears every couple seconds if the album was all what you wants and sometimes this would be an easy 10 but unfortunately that is not the case... at all. overall this album is just not good there are nice splotches here and there but looking at it from a contextual standpoint all these songs together as one to form an lp. not good. favourite tracks sometimes what you want least favourite tracks only shallow loomer when you sleep i only said come in alone,0
edit 27 may 2021 i decided to relisten to this album once again because i felt like giving it a second chance and it is with great certainty that i would like to say that this is still a 1.55. there is only three tracks that are a 2.55 or above on this album and only two that are above three stars. the rest of this album is either boring or painfully awful to sit through. touched and to here knows when are still one of the worst tracks i have heard. come in alone sounds like a non-acoustic version of my church choir it is bland and boring. sometimes is stupid. it is a shame that a great track like when you sleep was roped in to this diabolical mess. this album legitimately makes me think that my bloody valentine thought of two great tracks and decided to riff off those two tracks and make four more and on top of that make four more tracks that make no sense. if you like this album that is your opinion and i cannot get mad at that but i cannot see eye to eye with you. sorry. original review from 21 july 2020 below i have always wanted to get into shoegaze and this album specifically but now i realize that i have been making the biggest mistake of all time. i do not get the point of this album or what my bloody valentine were trying to accomplish. there were points where i had to take breaks while listening to this album because of how bad it was. i almost went to sleep because of this album. loveless is not for me. i will admit that there are some bright spots on this album. these bright spots are only shallow when you sleep i only said the chorus on only shallow is a very cool riff and the verses are kind of catchy. it does feel like it goes on for a big longer than it should have three verses for a song like this feels like a bit too much. the weird droning sounds are awesome. when you sleep is great all around. that synth-like guitar is sleek and a perfect fit and the verses are just amazing. i would argue that when you sleep is the best song on this album. in fact this is one of the only songs where the vocals are likeable. i only said has that weird melody going during the chorus and the drums are smooth. some of the songs would have benifited with less vocals such as only shallow and i only said. sometimes when i listen to these two songs i could have liked them way more if the vocals were not so over-dreamy. however the rest of this album is diabolical. there is so many ways i can describe the rest of this shitshow it is boring insulting melatonin it is like what the fuck? i have a question how do we go from a somewhat decent song with only shallow to three insufferable songs following after? loomer is so boring. what are the instrumentals trying to do? if confusion was the answer congratulations. this song makes no sense. the song following loomer is even worse. touched is dogshit and that is the best thing i can say about it. to here knows when is an actual song and yet it is as boring as the last two songs. it sounds like my bloody valentine were trying to accomplish everything yet the product sounds like nothing. to here knows when is the equivalent to unseasoned chicken. this song drones on for so long that i forgot that there were vocals. the only two good things on this song is the ending and that when you sleep comes after. the 30 second ending sounded way better than the 5 minute snoozefest. i am having a tough time picking between touched and to here knows when as the worst song on this album. touched is so fucking bad but at least it is only one minute. to here knows when is so boring and it goes on for 5 minutes. without moving away from talking about the vocals that is one of the biggest problems i have with this album the vocals. some people say that bilindas vocals are dreamy but i find that they ruin songs that could have been great and fuck over songs that were trash to begin with. i do not even know what she says more than half the time. if that is the point this is the shittiest concept album of all time. if that is the point of shoegaze it is the shittiest concept genre of all time. come in alone might start off decently on the first listen but like most songs on this album it gets ruined by the vocals. this song is slow yet still tries to sound like when you sleep which actually benefited from the speed. the mood each time the chorus comes in changes drastically which is not a good thing it just makes the listener mad. sometimes is more of the same as well strong start of a song ruined by the vocals. this time kevin shields wanted a part of the vocals. if this was supposed to be my bloody valentines version of a ballad they have failed in a major way. blown a wish is corny and what you want sounds like a cheap hybrid between only shallow and when you sleep. the ending makes me tired. i swear i heard a bruh sound effect in what you want. we wrap it all up with soon. to be honest i had high hopes for soon. i really thought that the song would at least give the album a strong finish---a saving grace even---but nope. soon sounds like a shoegaze spin on a cheesy teen pop song. at least it is somewhat catchy. the instrumentals are fine i can leave or take them. loveless somehow got popular but sometimes the people who make things popular are wrong. this album is not for me. i should not have to say this since it is my opinion but whatever sorry. 1.55,0
i get why this album is so revered. the heady tones of constant distortion just washes over you as you listen and it is incredible. when i first heard this album i was blown away by the grim majesty of it all as i had never heard anything like it. however as the years have gone by i have not only heard music of the same ilk that predates this but also music that is far more ambitious with what it tries to achieve. there are some amazing moments on here. i cannot deny how great it is to hear the album burst into life on the first track or wallow in the riff melding with the backing vocals on when you sleep. my issue is that all these great moments happen at the start of tracks. every song has such minimal development and it honestly gets a bit stale. this criticism can be applied to the whole album and while there are some nice changes between tracks because the album is loud all the way through the band have nowhere to go. you need some lows to appreciate the highs and the closest this album comes to that is to here knows when which has other issues that keep it from being very interesting. this lack of variation will become painfully apparent on soon which is a pretty unsatisfying ending. this album is really enjoyable. i know i have been harsh in my review but that is because it gets loads of praise already- i am just pointing out why i do not think it is anywhere near as incredible as it is made out to be.,0
this album sucks balls it tries to be all deep and philosophical but it just sucks balls at doing that! this album is for those edgy teenagers who think they are cool but they are really not so they act like they like this and give it 5 stars and any shoegaze can frick off too. 110,0

3  5 my bloody valentine were always in search of something in their aesthetic endeavors and it has always been loveless. it is where their intellectual discoveries were unanimously honored by the whole world. the balance of loveless brilliance comes from a violent storm of guitars surrounding a sweet and calm melodies. it evoked the beauty of nature in fury through a romantic persona. difficulty hard,0
i really wanted to like this album. lord knows i have tried but outside of roughly the first few songs there are not that many memorable moments. the songs tend to overstay their welcome especially in the latter half to the point of grating irritation. it is amazing that an album this noisy can be so dull and sedated. it is a shame because this could have been trimmed into a solid ep only shallow loomer to here knows when what you want,0
loveless 1991 by my bloody valentine is a cinma vrit-style documentary film that traces the story of the vinyl reissue of a lost album of my bloody valentines first seven studio albums. the film itself centers around the reissue of 1993s which disappeared for more than a decade before resurfacing as my bloody valentines first seven studio albums. the documentaries focus on this return to vinyl and are extremely well made and engaging although the viewer will want to know the history of the album itself. why did vinyl reissues never occur before? loveless also counts but the fact remains that there are plenty of songs that simply leave me cold. like say you made me realize. its simply too derivative to be worthwhile. remember when selling a song or band always take into consideration how the song fits in a scene or song that is already in place so if you are just jumping in and making a knock-off happy birthday because it is a commercial you might be committing a crime against pop culture and the other band members. then again if that song was the first song someone ever heard on a channel like mtv they probably did not have to know it was a copy of it could be considered a real song. can you think of,0
sometimes and soon are pretty interesting tracks but the rest of the record is monosonic and in the long run rather tiring. surely kevin shields spent a lot of effort to get the sound as it appears to be. the distorted guitars are pretty dominant and the other instruments and especially the vocals nearly disappear behind this guitar noise. unfortunately i do not like this a lot in the long run. sometimes und soon sind ziemlich interessante stcke aber der rest des albums ist eintnig und auf dauer ziemlich ermdend. kevin shields hat sich sicherlich viel mhe gegeben den sound genau so hinzukriegen wie er ist. die verzerrten e-gitarren sind sehr dominant und die anderen instrumente und speziell die vocals verschwinden fast unter diesem gitarren-noise. leider gefllt mir das auf dauer nicht sonderlich. top tracks sometimes soon,0
como  que algum pode gostar de um troo desses!,0
eu no sei at que ponto a mistura desbalanceada do dream pop com o noise foi calculado intencionalmente mas por vrios momentos a banda recorre ao dream e them outros ao noise como se estivesse indeciso por qual rota tomar. o que poderia ser um dos maiores defeitos se torna um dos seus maiores triunfos. um exemplo notrio dessa desorganizao so as faixas come in alone e sometimes sendo que a primeira  um noise pau mole que no sabe por onde seguir e a segunda praticamente uma balada romantica pop com ruidos. e o mais impressionante  que funciona them 70 do lbum. e casa com a letra. e a ambientalizao reflete muito melhor a gerao dos anos 20002010 do que parece ter refletido os anos 90. o problema so os outros 30 onde restam msicas vazias pouco inventivas que no precisavam estar no lbum. loveless  um lbum pretensioso ele no possui tanta potncia quando poderia ter e  bem irregular them sua estrutura mas seus bons momentos se destacam a ponto de conseguir justificar sua existncia e sua influncia se tornando um excelente pilar para o shoegaze.,0
some songs are really good but some are just meh if compared to other songs of the genre. these last ones can be really good too though if you are in the right mood.,0
though certainly listenable loveless is probably one of the most absurdly overrated albums in the history of popular music. and i have never been able to understand just why. on loveless mbv eschew what made them an outstanding band on their previous album great songwriting an acute sense of dynamics in favour of the stubborn exploration of a single idea. all the album offers is a collection of watered-down average indie pop songs disguised under a blanket of warm noise. a song like no more sorry on their previous album achieves much more in its less than 3 minutes than the whole loveless album on its 49 minutes of duration a triumph loveless? only if it is a triumph of style over substance or of single-mindedness over true creativity,0
granted the influence is great but holy fuck i could not even finish this i got so bored. i am sorry but it is going to take more than crappy mixing and 200 distortion pedals to peak my interest.,0
a while back when i first heard loveless i was incredibly disappointed with it since i was expecting some sort of ber-shoegaze album i did not get what i thought i was getting and dismissed it as a failure. since then i have come to realize that i did not really know what shoegaze was supposed to be. since coming to terms with that i have realized this album is actually pretty good. i am still not 100 sold on it like many people are but i can find a lot of good things in it. it has a lot of good melodies and the songwriting is pretty solid. some of the songs are even catchy. even though i initially hated the mix claiming i could not hear anything meaningful in it it is grown on me and it actually does further the atmosphere of the music pretty well and i am able to pick things out more easily as well. the dronenoise bits are also decentnot excellent but i do not expect them to be they are not a noisedrone band. i still do not find the songs to be super-engaging nor do i find the layers of noiseswirling guitars to be as blissful and amazing so it is not the awesome five-star ultimate rock album ever like a lot of people claim but it is still a pretty good album.,0
i really appreciate what they are going for here i really do but this just does not do it for me. it is a fantastic idea but it just does not work for my ears. many of the sounds on this album are really grating to me and the layers upon layers of noise on here can just completely bore me on some of these tracks. this is an album i really wish i enjoyed more because there really are some great moments here. sometimes is a wonderful song as well as only shallow i just wish the rest of the tracks on the album were more like those tracks.,0
i really cannot get myself into liking this album at all which is odd since i am a big fan of shoegaze. normally albums that mix it with other genres - which may be the reason i have no love for loveless. despite that there are a few good tracks i can bear namely when you sleep but overall i really do not care for or about this enough to carry on writing.,0
let me be honest here objectively this is not a terrible though also not a good one much less a great one album and the studio trickery is actually impressive from a technical standpoint. i just fucking hate it. of all the albums in the top 100 loveless easily the most limp-wristed and soulless. dsotm and ok computer are overrated as hell too but at least those albums actually have great songs. this is just moaning and discordant pop tracks with a shit ton of reverb and people think that makes it a masterpiece. i have never once found this album to be compelling in any manner. it is the soundtrack to every masturbating self-pitying insincere retard who thinks they are some sensitive martyr too precious for this world.,0
i mean yeah it does not sound like anything else i have ever heard and there are some admirable moments on here for sure. but i mean it just got sorta old to me as guilty as i feel admitting it because i know i will be persecuted for this. i mean whatever dude. i just found everything to come across as a jumbled mess of noises. i still like quite a few songs on this though. i honestly cannot remember some of the songs on this though and i have listened to this like 4 times. 610,0
this album is considered an excellent album by almost anyone who hears it. the famous reviewer piero scarrufi gave the album a 910 saying the songs are drifting and performed distractedly with no action taken and are destined to exist in this state of permanent awe.. this album is consistently part of any graphic depicting what is mu core and has been praised by the community for as long as i can remember. even within my own personal circles of music fans the album is hailed as a classic. but for me this album is none of those things. never before in my life have i tried so hard to like a piece of media. some work has jumped to me instantly as classics like the velvet underground  nico. some other pieces took more time for me to understand like trout mask replica. i thought that this album would fall into the latter category after my first listen. i have probably listened to this album all the way through at least a dozen times in different attempts to understand it but every time i come away with nothing inciteful to draw from and wishing i spent some time with music i actually enjoy. one of my least favorite parts about the album is something that is brought up constantly in favorable reviews of the album the mixing. i read about the mixing being this dream-like blend of noise that soothes the listener. i have never gotten this experience out of this album. every time i play the record the sound out of my speakers or my headphones sounds like the drivers are trying to push out oatmeal. it comes off as sloppy to me without any greater artistic acoustic or thematic purpose. it even is not that i do not like noise in my music as post-hardcore no wave post-rock and power electronics have produced some of my favorite albums. i think this album suffers from a case of too many cooks in the kitchen with over a dozen engineers to the albums credit. it is not that i even think the album is bad. some songs on here like i only said are real standouts that were able to click for me. the album as a whole does not. i love many of the albums that were directly influenced by this album but the source itself does little for me. maybe i will return to this album again and finally find what everyone else has but until then this album will remain misunderstood by me.,0
i appreciate what the album is trying to do - create this droning tone throughout the entire work. and while this is new to me new does not equal good. most of the album sounds identical save for only shallow. i think that my bloody valentine could have done a better job of producing this tone while still giving each track personality and charm. highlights only shallow,0
noioso a tratti carino,0
just admit that you do not know about how popular this album is and listen to it with open ears. to me it sounded 1 sandpaperish on ears throughout 2 tunes one just like others 3 at the same time very original. but i see no reason to return to it to finally find its greatness behind the layers of noise noise and noise.,0
i am surprised what year this came out 1991. i figured it would need to be a little longer before musicians could make such a haunting and powerful sound coming out of my earbuds. everything is thrown up in the air the guitar is having a wonder while making riffs and wails everywhere. i think the instruments trump the main vocalist butcher though. the vocals is actually what made it need a few listenings to click. you need this in your niche for noise and in general dark and moody tunes that only the late 20th and 21st century could ever really make.,0
i have very mixed feelings on this. the opener is fantastic and after that i am kind of waiting for something amazing to brush my ears and it never quite happens. on the whole i like this album but i like a couple thousand albums many of them much more than this. no question it is beyond influential it is unique and textured so densely it is like drowning in tar. but it just does not quite scratch the itch i always feel a bit short changed.,0
even though i do not like this album i will not go lower than a 2.5 because there is nothing about it that i particularly dislike expect maybe the melody of when you sleep. the other side of that coin though is that i do not really like anything about it either. this is the musical equivalent of diluted fruit punch. it does not leave a bad taste in my mouth but it leaves me thinking that it could have been so much more. i am all for atmospheric production but that is where the creativity of this album ends. loveless does not do anything to justify its hazy vibes. there is no detail in the production and none of the melodies are close to memorable aside from the first track. this thing just goes in one ear and out the other. it is not even good music to just have on in the background as a lot of the dissonance and muddy production are pretty distracting. so yeah i do not get the hype.,0
i cannot get into this album. i do not think shoegaze is my genre. there is a couple songs i think are decent like only shallow. but as a whole i just do not really find enjoyment. i understand others liking this though. i get that it is about the atmosphere. it just does not do too much for me.,0
for ben i plan on listening to this with earphones on in my bedroom tonight. not sure if this will be before or after begging my mother to see crywank,0
this is an incredible inspirational record yet at the same time aggravating and anxiety-inducing. more than enough people have already commented on the good qualities of the album so i will summarize the bad. three key negatives in increasing order of harm one the male singer. why? why does he ever sing? he is not good. amateur at best. the female singer is gorgeous. stick with her. two the jarring transitions. i am literally shaken multiple times every time i play this album a song does a great job of entrancing me in a nice dreamy state and then scares the fuck out of me with a smashing powerful chorus to kick off a track. i would like something a bit smoother. three the repetitiveness. do i need an album to be atonal and multi genred? of course not do not strawman me in your head like that. does the looping refrain and drums get extremely predictable and similar as the album goes on? hell yes. there is so many cool things going on in this album yet it so frequently uses its own sound as inspiration for more of itself. i feel like i am driving in a roundabout and at every turn i can see these great things in the distance but i miss my turn and end up back where i was. so frustrating! overall it is good but nothing more. top album of its year? give me a break the 90s are over stop letting nostalgia cloud your judgment.,0
i might be one of the few people who just enjoy the songs just for the songs themselves rather than the wall of noise. this aspect of the music does not do too much for me with this particular band.,0
i guess i understand why this album is so highly rated. it is a contender for the best-sounding album of all time. all the whacky recording and production techniques the band employed make loveless still sound unique today. sure people have tried to recreate the magic but you still know when you are listening to the real loveless and not some bedroom producer-ass wannabe. they will never capture the thick ghosts of sound that mbv did! so why did i give it a 35 then? the answer is pretty unsatisfying the songwriting does not click with me. well it clicks three or four times. loveless would be an absolute favorite of mine if it was a 19 minute ep with a tracklisting of only shallow when you sleep sometimes and what you want. only shallow is a great way to start the album off. it is so heavy and satisfying. it makes me know that i am beginning a classic. when you sleep is simply one of the greatest songs i have heard in my life. it is so bittersweet that it breaks my heart every time i hear it. it just so innocent and melodic! i love it so much! i am trans!!! not actually sometimes is the perfect song to listen to when you have a broken heart and you are laying on a couch. what you want is pretty good... ..... .... ... everything else is just sleepy to me unfortunately. the melodies are only okay and they repeat forever until i forget that i am listening to music. it is weird because there is nothing tangibly different between my favorite tracks and the others. maybe i just have really bad taste. i listen to fucky. part of rymasters volume five i journey through systematicdeclines top 100 abandoned,0
loveless is perhaps the album that i most appreciate but do not necessarily enjoy. this is an attempt at something that i think the world needs more of texture-based rockpop music and for 1991 i greatly appreciate the effort of something like that being done. there is just one problem the textures range from uninteresting to dated and incredibly obnoxious to me. while some of the tracks are pretty great sometimes it still suffers the same fate as other tracks. the melody that comes in later on in the track is great but the actual texture of it feels very artificial and ugly to me but this is definitely the best use of these textures throughout the album. this problem persists on pretty much every single track with either the melody or harmony being played by some ugly artificial and dated sounding texture that completely takes me out of the mood the album is going for. the worst offender of these is i only said which has probably the worst texture of them all and it is mixed so loudly and it loops so incessantly over the 5 12 minute runtime that it destroys any semblance of stomachability that this track had for me. the drum sound is also not very good for most of the album a side effect of a drum machine being used for most of it. that is not even to mention the songwriting which is pretty much just standard alt rock to me with nothing really standing out aside from the aforemented sometimes. even when the texture does not get in the way on a track like only shallow for example the songs are not really interesting enough for it to make a difference. all the respect in the world to people that like this album but i have been waiting for 3 years for this thing to click but it only seems to get more and more frustrating with time. sorry.,0
with complete seriousness every song after only shallow sounds like a bunch of irishmen farting around on grating guitar soundscapes and unintelligible and unpleasant vocalization. i cannot do it man. i cannot. i really detest my bloody valentine,0
just too much going on in this album. it is just all over the place and does not feel cohesive at all. basically it is like i was just listening to a bunch of otherworldly noises that a computer could create automatically. just not feelin it. i like psychocandy by the way. maybe after a hit of acid i could get into this kind of fuzzy style over substance stuff.,0
so uhhh this was better than is not anything at least. loveless was a bit more consistent overall compared to is not anything but once again it is rather monotone and boring. mbv sound like an indie rock band who were randomly inspired by sonic youth and decided to add a bunch of noise to their music. now while i am a champion of noise distortion grunge and the like in my music it just makes this album muddy and samey. i feel like it could have been better if all of that noise mud was cleared up and they had gone for a cleaner sound which would lend to their pop-like sound hidden underneath.,0
can i possibly be hearing the same thing as the people who love this album? httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikifoliec3a0deux,0
now really what do i have to say about loveless? the music gave me headaches the first time i heard ithell it still doesbut what kept me at this album was partly the acclaim and partly those vocal harmonies. loveless was like nothing i would heard before. it transcended the boundaries of what i considered rock music. now those very same harsh guitars that drove me away from this album contain effervescent qualities to them. the subtle bubbling that emulates life and hope in the world. even at the most accosting moments of loveless an indivisible force continues to pull my mind within its world of soundscapes. even as the initial appeal that to here knows when begins to slow down which in itself was the revival from touched when you sleep comes on. the action of the album exponentiates as when you sleep reaches its apex and i only said shifts in. the actual music here actually does not have a big impact on me. what it has done for music and for me that is what is important.,0
i do not know why but i do not love this album. at least as much as other people do. i am a fan of shoegaze but here i feel the melody is too drowned in distortion. there are certainly songs i truly enjoy when you sleep is a personal favorite and i can understand the aesthetic and technical innovation here. but the rest of the album fails to connect with me and it does not have the sense of variety or momentum i was hoping for after hearing such high praise of it.,0
i am sorry because i am sure that many here will disagree with me on this review but nonetheless i have to be honest for my integritys sake. this is perhaps the single most overrated album at rym and possibly in the history of modern music. not only is this music really bad ... terribly bad. purposefully off-key and static-y ... but this album is rated as top 7 of all time albums on here. i had no idea that so many people had such bad taste. i mean - i would rather listen to the sound of new york city traffic for hours on end over this pile of shiznit. seriously. again - i am being honest. the only reason i rate this album 2 stars rather than 1 is because the vocals are actually very good! but sadly great vocals are not saved by shite music!,0
brummm brummmm brummmmmm sleep like a pillow no one there where she will not care anywhere soft as a pillow touch her there where she will not dare somewhere brummm brummmm brummmmmm hmmmm... anspieltip when you sleep kaufempfehlung wohl klassiker aber nicht meiner!,0
loveless definitely has a shock factor associated with it the first time you listen to it. heck the first ten or twenty times even. but after you get past the adrenaline rush of listening to the best vacuum cleaners you have ever heard you realize that underneath that layer there is only a couple of fairly simple alt rock songs. and that would be entirely fine if these songs were not so tediously repetitive. the biggest offender is i only said which has a pretty good violin melody which gets repeated until you cannot stand it anymore but honestly the same applies to most of the songs after the first three. only shallow is easily the best track on here followed by loomer. i only want to listen to this occasionally when i have forgotten what the vacuums sound like and want to re-experience it for a bit. but on any given day i would much rather listen to something like ujubasajuba which has the added benefit of being available on spotify in my country.,0
bleh. not my thing. if i want to zone out to a dense fuzzy album that feels like it is damaging my hearing then i will spin some emperor.,0
tuneless tripe. and even if there were tunes under all that noise why should i have to wade through the noise to get to them? it is not worth the effort.,0
boring and overly pretentious.,0
seit fast 25 jahren hre ich mir diese platte immer mal wieder an um herauszufinden was ich verpasst habe aber ich komm nicht drauf. immer wieder versuche ich zu ergrnden was so viele an dieser platte so gut und so elementar finden. erst heute wieder habe ich es versucht wirklich versucht. ich wrde gerne eine bessere wertung geben aber die platte erreicht mich einfach nicht. vielleicht kann es mir jemand erklren. ich hre gerne indie ich hre auch gerne shoegazer aber hier ist mir zuviel noise mit zuwenig guten melodien. meiner meinung nach gibt es bessere shoegazer-platten und viel bessere indie-platten. aber ich gebe nicht auf. vielleicht belehrt mich ja jemand und sagt mir genau wodrauf ich achten muss. und wenn ich sie dann nochmal hre bin ich ach gerne bereit meine wertung zu verndern auch wenn das keinen interessiert. ,0
enjoyable but way overrated. the vocals are pleasant but of the generic dreamy female rock vox variety and the songwritings really nothing special. what sets it apart is the atmosphere the murky layered guitars drenched in feedback. basically the album sounds like it is fretboard drowning in cough syrup album cover.,0
loveless is one of those albums whose monumental praise is hard to escape. i would heard of my bloody valentine far before i was even really into music and i have seen the cover for loveless plastered on just about every top albums list imaginable. everywhere it is mentioned everyone talks about the story behind it. how kevin shields bankrupted the label trying to get the right sound and moving through several studios. how the label mishandled everything and the album went unknown until later appreciation came about. the main problem with this story is that it is bullshit. shields has since admitted that the label was already bankrupt when they started the album and it seems that the whole background story for this album was started as a sort of marketing gimmick. not only that but the more i read about this albums production the less effort it seemed like the band really put into this lp. the fact of the matter is that loveless is a memorable sonic experience but an almost entirely forgettable songwriting experience. the waves of fuzzy distorted guitars piled on top of each other droning on for minutes at a time create a very distinct a lush sound for the songs while the vocals are pushed far back into the mix and the drums even further back. it seems that these two elements were pushed back because upon further inspection they are pretty damn bad. the lyrics and i hesitate to even really call them that make no sense and were essentially written as a half baked guessing game between shields and butcher. i am a firm believer that if you do not have good lyrics you should not include them in your music if you want pleasant vocals just pull a sigur ros and sing nonsense openly do not pretend like you have something to say. production aside this is one of the most lopsided albums ever recorded. the first half is clearly superior to the second with pretty much every track after come in alone being dispensable. the first half though has quite a few nice tracks when you sleep is the obvious highlight of the album with its high pitched squeeling guitar refrain and only shallow is a pretty kickass opening track. touched has a very unique sound to it that makes me wish it were longer and to here know when and loomer like all the songs on side two are ultimately pretty mediocre but they get by because they have a unique sound. i suppose if you really love the aesthetic of this albums sound you will probably think its a perfect album. but if you dig just below the surface to analyze what is actually going on musically i think you will find that it is a somewhat half-assed effort. i am certain the hype and marketing of this album played no small role in its adoption as a sort of decade defining masterpiece it would have to because this album on its own merits does not deserve all the praise it gets. overall cool sound just could have used a cooler band.,0
perhaps i would enjoy this album a lot more if at least a couple more songs actually had tunes underneath all the haze.,0
monotone singers which sound hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggggggghhhhhhhh as hell. repetitive guitar chords. simplistic song styles. but it works for me. the atmosphere on this album is pretty epic! and a lot of the beats are pretty damn cool. though i could not understand a word that the talkers were saying. i refuse to call them singers. still it seems crazy to call this the 9th best album of all-time. but it is pretty damn unique. the b-side is much better than the a-side.,0
lo tengo l 25 anni in un luogo protetto al buio e al fresco per degustarlo al momento giusto e quando finalmente lo apro cosa scopro? quello che tutti gli amici di rym dicevano fosse un chateau latour del 1991 risulta essere una coca cola anche un po sgasata. mah! che scherzi.magari non era da invecchiare...,0
i crashed with a wall of boring noises and a dispassionate voice.,0

you know what this reminds me of? a cocktail maybe a pink mojito. something sweet and bright that makes me feel buzzed and sleepy. even the occasional dissonant noises are not that offputting if anything they add to the ambience. but what can i get from this that i cannot from picopop apart from bilinda butchers lovely vocals? both have a wall of sound effect but something like super miracle circuit is just much more sonically diverse and plain old appealing to me at least. loveless is immersive and relaxing i will give it that and it is very pretty but a bit on the monotonous side. i just do not see how this is so groundbreaking. and i like it but it does not spark anything in me.,0
tra i dischi che vorrei pi amare in assoluto c loveless dei my bloody valentine. uso il condizionale perch a fine ascolto rimango sempre con un po di amaro i bocca. complessivamente lalbum mi piace moltissimo. ha unorganicit non indifferente ottime melodie sognanti avvolte da una pellicola noise che non prende mai il predominio. tutto  fatto molto bene compresa la splendida voce di bilinda butcher ottimamente accompagnata dalle parti di kevin shields. allora perch non  uno dei miei dischi preferiti di sempre? a conti fatti trovo che lunica canzone epocale sia when you sleep assieme alle belle only shallow e sometimes. tutto il resto  funzionale ma meno ispirato. da un album cos incensato onestamente pretendo di pi. chiudo ribadendo che when you sleep  roba da polluzione notturna.,0
bandcamp is a bad word these days. brings to mind images of poorly thought-out aesthetics and people dabbling in genres for no real reason. throw-away one-off act-less etc. and this album this is why. see this is probably the most popular indie release ever. it is here on rym. and because of that the ideas sounds and aesthetics here get copied and rehashed and redone sometimes on purpose and sometimes totally by accident. could be that a band was influenced by another band who was influenced by another band and so on down the line until you reach my bloody valentine. a dude i know just started a shoegaze band and released an ep on bandcamp and i am pretty sure the only shoegaze he is heard is this and feast of love. what i do not think he realizes is this album cost the bands label around a quarter of a million pounds and also that pity sex is not very good. you just cannot make this stuff in a couple weeks on a thousand dollar budget. i am all for independent music but this stuff has got to stop. bandcamp is a bad word because nobody is trying anything new and everybody wants to put their derivative under-length projects up as fast as possible. it is a miracle that anybody even heard deathconsciousness. anyway about the actual content here loveless is in a word dated. it is a good album and i am sure that it like her big brother nevermind were pretty mindblowing at the time i guess nobody had heard hsker d yet but today loveless just sounds like an alt rock record. same with nevermind. sure there is lots of cool ideas riffs and they are certainly unique to a point but in the end it is a sound that was once cutting edge and is now old and dull. you have got to be so high that you have forgotten about slowdive and have a nice life to really enjoy this as the five-star album it is said to be. even the standout tracks here only shallowto here knows whenwhen you sleepi only saidsoon wear out their welcome incredibly quickly with one riff or chord progression rotating in a way that for a less immediate-sounding band like have a nice life would be flattering but for my bloody valentine after a couple listens starts to feel less and less mature thought out etc... even the lyrics here are on that billy corgan level of just pushing the 13 year old aesthetic and all this albums parts only work in a vacuum free from the culture and music of the last 25 years. i try hard to listen to music in a vacuum i think it lends to a better listening experience but for loveless for me now that the first impression has worn off it is almost impossible. verdict still a classic whatever that means,0
so this is the new velvet underground  nico and ok computer  new despite having been released about 23 years ago today. while the average rating of most highly rated albums have been going down at rym loveless has been almost constantly heading up. so is it that good? what do you expect from a reviewer whose favourite vu album is loaded favourite radiohead album is kid a and favourite stereolab album is cobra and phases group play voltage in the milky night? honestly despite having heard some my bloody valentine back in the early 1990s at my friends i used to think it was loveless but it must really have been is not anything i was almost shocked when the first sounds of only shallow met my ears. someone goes into a studio takes a lot of time and produces a sound like this? weird!! i did not know if that was a good or bad thing. the soundscape remains very ground-breaking to my ears on the other hand music is not only sound and this dominant sound buries most other musical features under the surface. however if the music is otherwise strong enough that can be forgiven and embraced. now we are facing the question are the songs of loveless strong enough? yes and no. when you sleep what you want and the lengthy closing number soon which might be played between happy mondays and early atomic swing are the most decent while i only said sometimes blown a wish and the aforementioned only shallow are not much worse. so after all the dominant feature on loveless is still the overall sound. i like it in a way of course. but perhaps what loveless really is is the merriweather post pavilion of the 1990s. i prefer this one and naturally mbv was around first but anyway the tricks are similar.,0
un absoluto montn de mierda. slo para adolescentes esnobs y pajilleros de rym.,0
the vocals a mere whispering the rest an almost impenetrable wall of noise. my bloody valentine created the epitome of shoegaze with their third album loveless. whereas the title hints at something cold and harsh the performance is rather sensitive with the sheer drone of all the layers of guitars as a protecting blanket for the melancholy band. as the album oscillates between more concise yet hazy indie rock only shallow noisy random songwriting to here knows when and odd keyboard miniatures touched diversity unfortunately falls by the wayside. this makes the album feel longer as it actually is. loveless may be genre defining but it also is a huge blurry dirge that leaves little room for particularly inspired moments. highlights only shallow lowlights to here knows when,0
there is a thing about concept albums although they show new ways to make musiccreate whole new genres they rarely work as an actual sonic experience. loveless is just a template for others to come and refine it so it can sound good. a noble first that i approve of but very little in terms of substance. there is simply not much here that i actually enjoy listening.,0
usually i do like shoegaze and noisy stuff but this album somehow failed quite a bunch on me. even though it is apparently something that is a classic i struggled to find this interesting. i do like the album cover and the sounds is quite ok for most time. but the thing with this album is that it was quite much a dream poppy take of shoegaze. and as i kept listening i got more and more bored with the album as variety seems to be an unknown element here. the album keeps going and going and going but atleast i did not find that much evolution or new elements on it after listening a while. might be a classic but this apparently just was not for me.,0
this is a good album as that it is better than most though it has flaws. to this listener it sounds like the band has an original sound but they do it to death. almost like they wrote the same song over and over. also there is kind of a outdated 90s rock sound at times which is still commendable because it predates all that possibly influenced much of it. alot of the songs have only two parts it switches back and forth too. there is a repetitiveness which may evoke a certain mindset the artists were intending for the listener i personally have a problem with. there is alot of nice sounding parts within though. it starts off strong but starts wearing a little thin.,0
it is like these guys discovered something completely untouched and relevant but did not know what to do with it in the end. after all how far can fuzz go in making a song truly good?,0
the perception of a good album as a collection of some good songs have recently became a common knowledge. the concept album died and people almost does not listen to whole albums any more. my bloody valentines loveless is an album from another era when the medium of the album considered as more important than the medium of the song. a clear concept or at least a partial musical uniformity was any albums duty. the problem with the album era which seems so alluring in the nostalgia district is the lack of attention to the song as an independent art work regardless of the context of it is album. theoretically loveless is a fine album. the sound is interesting the development is surprising the concept exists. but the songs? santa maria. mostly they are as long as the amazonas. unfortunately the lyrics are not necessarily as deep as the amazonas but who cares it is impossible to understand anything that this miserable singers say behind their bad diction and a thick layer of the indefensible over distorted guitars and the kitschy synthesizer. nowadays to make a good pop album a well done entirety is not enough. every song in an album should be both specifically good and connected to the whole album. i sad to say that loveless just does not stand the test of time.,0
still really good but i feel like it could have been better without all that noise and feedback layered on top. whenever you get a nice melody you also have to contend with something noisy at the same time. not a holy grail as some would have you believe but it is still got some very nice songs on there my favorites being when you sleep come in alone and sometimes. real solid.,0
lay down some fuzz and throw an oft-irritating whiny melodic guitar hook on top. sometimes seems to break the mould somewhat and stray into more notably effective territory negating some of the awkwardly dated sound and execution. it is pleasantly inoffensive and flows well i guess. 2.5 stars  mediocre,0
luckily i have almost no background in dream popshoegazewhatever shit term you come with to vindicate instilling a doze of sugary poppy catchiness into your repetitive artsy indie rock. so i can judge this album on its musical merits alone without taking into account how much influential groundbreaking or successful with its prospective audience it was. yeah i know that loveless is a highly revered album and often seen as some sort of peaking achievement regarding the whole 80s90s alternative scene. but you know i am a frank guy and this sort of things cannot prevent me from declaring loveless as useless crap if i am feeling exactly that way. so on the rolling drums loveless is a prime example of useless crap. those pseudo-creative middle-class hipsters who feel offended by this candid statement can give up on reading my review already but i will explain my opinion with slightly more detailing. dreamy soundscapes pulsating bass and fuzzy but subtle guitars can be good even if set in a totally mellow and very electronized setting. but this type of music can be good when it is supported by bright and lucid melancholic melodies genuine union between fluid clear songs flow and clever use of crescendoes and stuff like that which enhances it with a sense of progression and variability. as long as you still have guitars some solid riffs will not hurt either. but on loveless the situation is drastically different. extremely repetitive and bland simple guitar chords cannot be interpreted as something worthwhile even with all the deliberate blurriness of sound which actually muffles and drown  them out as you can guess taken into account. annoying joyously feel-good primitive poppy melodies cannot invest you with some sort of melodic brilliance. heavy-handed use of inoffensive and trite noise-rock elements does not make you forward-thinking and avantgarde. clicky drums really taxing listeners patience with their extremely monotonous and uninventive character and sloppy dance-ish beats do not help either. and wait a moment on the top of all this ill-fated malady we have that god-awful vocals. you can be mellow and good. friggin pink floyd proved it. but this infamous amount of syrupy saccharine bullshit of vocals yet these vocals are definitely pretentious and surely get lauded as being so original and conjured with outside-the-box mentality by worthless pitchforkian musical critics is maybe the most annoying feature of mbvs music. these saccharine vocals suit sugary melodies though but if some shitty feature looks appropriate to some other shitty feature there is nothing to be overexcited about. you know hysterical mumble suits hitlers message of hate high-societys arrogant bitch appearance suits thatchers creepy character being terribly ugly suits lady gagas ludicrous make-up and comic antics onstage toothless sappy melodies of my bloody valentine suit mawkish bilinda butchers vocals shields ones are not significantly better by the way. by the way bilinda first i mind it not e she is so original and unlike you dirty proles! butcher - hell it is even a more laughable name than balsac the jaws of death from gwar only her is real. well i am done. it is a worthless crap. but what do you want from a band with a name as lame as my bloody valentine? st. vitus demonstrated us that albums with pink cover can be damn solid. but here we have a sonical equivalent of a crime against humanity. a couple of half-decent melodies lost in this sea of poppy cheese dressing up as progressive thinking music save loveless from being rated with 0.5 stars but it comes terribly close to it. this insipid gutless and primitive album surely deserves a mention as one of the most overrated albums of all time. as flavor flav once kindly put it do not believe the hype.,0
i just cannot really get into this. everything sounds nice and all but the only real stand-out tracks for me are sometimes and soon. only shallow starts off really well with that drum but the following couple of minutes just do not really connect with me. as does most of this. i come back to it every now and then because i like the general sound of it and see it as a agreeable-to-good album but i cannot shake the feeling that there is something here i am missing.,0
acab durante ms de 10 minutos repasando el disco original a ver si el que me lo vendi me haba dado el cambiazo puesto que los comentarios de la gente en los que suelo estar de acuerdo lo ponan por las nubespues en fin....lo he puesto una veintena de veces y hasta alguna noche me he parado a pensar que coo pasa con este disco que no consigo hacerme con l la voz me parece mala no... lo siguiente su msica carece de sentido alguno y en algunos tramos me hacen intentar olvidar a algunas tardes de trabajo en una factora de coches de cuyo nombre no quiero recordar si esto es todo lo mejor que nos poda dejar esta gente quiz sea mejor que no vuelvan a sacar nada ms. que este disco est en la lista por encima del kind of blues o a love supreme o el ziggy stardust es un autntico insulto a la msica. y por supuesto no est ni en mi listado de los 100 mejores de los 90. si esto es una obra maestra tenemos el listn rozando suelo. sigamos al rebao de comentarios seores.,0
i feared it would be worse to my taste just another shoegazey borefest. it still caused me a headache but i did find some pretty rocking grooves and the thing overall still has more balls than their peers.,0
really good. it is a pop album that gets it is catchiness from the texture of the sound foregoing the usual chord progression style. recommended.,0
bleh. not my thing. if i want to zone out to a dense fuzzy album that feels like it is damaging my hearing then i will spin some emperor.,0
this collection of random guitar-related noises just hurts my ears.,0
one of the best things about loveless is how many adjectives come to my mind when i think of it. there is simply so much here to explore. i have listened to it hundreds of times and have never tired of its perfection or thought it any blander from how great it was when it first clicked with me. it is strange to me that anyone would suggest that loveless is anything but flawless. although it occurred to me the other day that soon is perhaps slightly too long and i can definitely understand that everyone has a preference for certain songs off of it. but the song order on this album is immaculate and its originality and sculptural noisy beauty is unsurpassed. the melodies in songs like come in alone and when you sleep are so saccharine and utterly perfect. i see loveless as a gorgeous painting conceived under the influence of a powerful hallucinatory trance. songs like i only said and blown a wish exemplify the androgynous fetal beauty that characterizes the album. the sensual seductive guitar riffs and painterly waves of static are what make it so tantalizing to me. my understanding of its brilliance only improves with each listen but ultimately its most important accomplishment is its blending of textural sonic art with the pop music formula. i simply see loveless as a monolithic piece of visual physical music that also happens to be comprised of pop songs. everything that sounds anything like it owes it to this album. loveless is essential not only because of its wide-ranging influence but its landmark accomplishment of being such a unique sensory record that makes the listener feel sensations that do not exist on any other album.,0
first in the mid to late 90s and was left perplexed it was a bit early on or seemed to be on the internet induced lovefest of this album before it became totally uncool to not like it but it was becoming more and more uncool by the day. i snatched this up at my favorite music store rip farwell music in milwaukee wi. i remember taking it home with all kinds of expectations it was a known album do not get me wrong but was not one of those--my god there is nothing better than ever insert hipster this second with hipster that and close with hipster hipster albums..... i turned it on and instantly was greated with a great guitar sound.... but then the vocals kicked in and yech..... i tried for a few months and still yech.... i think i actually ended up giving this for nothing to my best friendcollege roommate.....he liked it for what it is worth..... ok so since those days midlate 90s the internet lore has skyrocketed so maybe in late 2011 i checked this out from the library hopingwishing that maybe some 13-15 yrs on perhaps my tastes had changed a la here come the warm jets--eno and i would really dig this guy.... well know...it is the vocals they grate my soul. i cannot stomach this one. 15 seems both fair and accurate. sorry i cannot buy in .,0
no soy muy amante del shoegaze pero hay que reconocer que esta es el mejor album del movimiento. se denota melodia y sentimiento debajo de este manto de ruido... en el coche he tenido que cortar la musica un par de veces pensando que tenia una averia...,0
loveless is one of the few examples where you can call an album beautiful in a literal way. the biggest mistake you can make is to try to judge it for individual songs the album never been about that i always look at it as some kind of a session a feeling a whole... when you look at it as a composition of dreamy sounds that make everything in your head look like that pink cover you will get it...,0
there are some incredible songs on this album and there are some unbearable ones too.,0
i liked the first song and then they kept repeating it over and over and over and over...with more noise each time. finally i got sick of it and started fast-forwarding. to each their own.,0
i have done a fair amount of musical experimentation myself along the way and i have not been afraid to break out some incredible delay and droning feedback here and there. there have been times when i have put together a wall of sound so devious it would send packs of wolves whining into the night. the difference is that i never had the gall to try to release such explorations. now i suppose this can be looked at one of two ways. one perhaps i have missed out on an excellent opportunity to release an album that would be looked back upon years later as an undisputed classic one that could be considered a launching pad for a thousand dreamy nights and the seed for a whole series of musical revolutions. or two i have done the world a service by not unleashing such raucous offerings upon the public at large. i will decline to pick a side. but what must be said is that if i experimented with such sounds in the years before this album was released i likely was not the only one. the rest of us just were not geniusvindictive enough to carry it beyond our own 4 walls.,0
why the hell this album is so well-rated? i am tolerant open-minded and stuff but come on. i just do not get it.,0
there i listened to it. and?... now do not get me wrong. i am not implying that this is a bad album or anything. but a 4.2 score is certainly not justified 4.2 being the reason i checked this out. it is a pretty good dream pop album but it is nothing spectacular and does not have anything that makes it stand out from other albums by groups like lush cranes heart throbs etc.,0
3,0
this was a big disapointment - i expected it to be way better considering the rating here. this is an ok album completely inoffensive and extremely consistent but it really drags after a while and nothing on this grabs me at all. i suppose the guitars are well done - the layers of guitar create a droning effect that sounds cool but does not really give much musical or emotional impact to the songs. in fact the album sounds way too homogenous - you have got virtually the same droning multi-layered guitar sounds pretty much non-stop for 45 minutes. this actually gets really nerve-racking after a while and i have to turn it off - i think i have only made it throught the whole album once. it is particularly annoying through headphones. would have been much better if they had varied the approach a little. also the singing is mediocre mixed way too low and adds little or nothing to the songs. i have no idea what any of the lyrics are - i think i could identify one actual word over the entire album. this might be an incredible acheivement in terms of sound engineeringrecording and guitar technique but it is only decent mood music at best. the smashing pumpkins took essentially the same sound but made much more out of it in the mid-nineties.,0
not sure quite what i was expecting here - but i was thoroughly bored. the dissonant sections just sound like standard 90s dance music drownd in thin noise. the lighter sections just sound like standard 90s dance music but moany. certain pieces verged on the quite listenable but not enough of it rose above average for it is lofty critical perch.,0
what to say about loveless... well the guitars are awesome. really beautifully crafted work of genius. the vocals are preposterous that bitch cannot sing for good and her voice is pretty annoying. the drums are not bad but mixed far too much behind. the overall mastering is bad. i would still give it 610.,0
i thought that i would like the album way more than i did. i loved the first jesus and mary chain and i was thinking that this would be something similar. it kind of is but not really. i did not like the first four songs so things did not bode well for the rest of the album but i ended up enjoin six of the last seven songs. as long as you can deal with the beautiful melodies being drowned by layers of distorted guitar and what not you will like this album. the standout tracks start with when you sleep i only said  and come in alone. the rest of the outstanding songs are sometimes what you want and soon. if you enjoy shoegaze music i highly recommend this album. there are a lot of great melodies hidden behind the wall of noise. check this out!,0
considerably boring and monotonous which says a lot coming from someone who can easily enjoy lustmord. i have enjoyed sometimes since the first time i heard it years ago but the rest of the album falls incredibly short in comparison and only occasionally shows off sparks of interesting possibilities that end up dissipating into shreds of disappointment. overrated and undeserving of it is relentless hipster praise does not even cut it when trying to speak about this album.,0
cuando no se tiene mucha idea de msica o se tiene el talento de un marc bolan o unos ramones o casi que es mejor dejarlo. pero claro tambin est la va alternativa de aprovecharse del ramalazo pedante de algunos y parir porqueras como sta. por lo visto estos mindundis a falta de un mnimo talento para la composicin se dedicaron aqu a superponer capas y capas de sonido -a saber en qu momento decidieron parar y por qu razn- y a aadirles la voz de un meningtico recin levantado. la intencin no era otra que hacer algo fresco y novedoso como dictaban los cnones de la prensa musical y dems esnobs de parvulario y la cosa como es lgico les sali redonda. una simplonada como un templo. lo suyo es que se hubiesen quedado mezclando y superponiendo capas de sonido ad eternum y que este pedazo de mierda no hubiese visto nunca la luz.,0
i get the appeal. i can see why people likeloveenjoy it. 7 all time seems a bit crazy to me but still this record is widely considered a classic and i am good with it. all in all it is not for me. i revisit once a year or so to see if it clicks. i appreciate the guitarsdense production. that is about it. it is ok. if you do not like only shallow nothing going forward is going to be enjoyable. to here knows when is the only thing i skip every time. the rest is decent to me nothing special.,0
attuned overrated noise.,0
good overall mood and some great songs overall though it does not hit me like it does some.,0
i have softened my views on this album but i still do not fully get it i reckon. it is certainly a nice mix of melody and noise but shoegaze is general is a genre i have tended to dislike. now being widely considered best in something i usually do not like might negate some of the negative feeling but i still do not love this. rating changed from 3.0 to 3.5 on 122321 favorite tracks only shallow when you sleep sometimes,0
i do not get it.,0
the seminal shoegaze band whose style has influenced the smashing pumpkins and other grunge luminaries with their heavy use of feedback and droning ethereal vocals. an easy album to admire but not to adore at least from my point of view. it may grow on me but it all sounds like one song to me. the vocals just seemed to be drowned out by the noise which makes me feel nauseous.,0
it is a gorgeous album for sure pleasantly disorienting in a way that few others are... but uninteresting once one has became adjusted to its unique sound because there is little depth beside that dreamy sound itself - not in melody lyrics or other instrumentation - to discover or appreciate.,0
i must say that i have underrated this critically acclaimed classic. but if i must try to save myself here i must say that i would say it the highest 3 and half stars that i possibly could. i find the potential here to range past five stars but i still regardlessly find the album a bit of an anachronism and in that i am unable to fully connect in a way that i would otherwise with another album. i always find it hard to discern whether something is great because it precedes something or whether its great because its truly great. i asked myself this question about loveless and what i found was well... sort of. maybe when i re ask myself in the future i will have a new answer but for now i find the album to hold truly worthwhile content especially for having been created before i was even born.,0
an album that takes the sonic fuzz experimentation of the velvet underground in the 60s and the jesus and mary chain in the 80s and makes the genres statement for the 90s. hugely textured and unique but searing on the ears.,0
i tried very hard to like this album more than i did and while i certainly found it engaging as an overall listen i could not overlook the large patches of noise that had no melodic backbone. as a result i was left wondering why this album has left such a legacy in its wake not because it is not influential but because sooo many people cite it as groundbreaking. i will admit however that when my bloody valentine combines noise rock with hook-driven melody as on tracks like when you sleep and sometimes the results are astounding. i will also admit if you consider smashing pumpkins an essential 90s band then yes this album is groundbreaking in many ways since it is to billy corgan what the pixies were to rivers cuomo and maybe kurt cobain too.,0
most likely the most overrated album ever...,0
um lbum sobrevalorizado pelos ecos nostlgicos do presente que fica a dever muito ao seu antecessor is not anything. gostei muito de when you sleep mas o resto fica muito aqum them termos de qualidade.,0
before i start this review i have to tell you that i have very ambivalent feelings about shoegaze in general. it can be absolutely brilliant if the musicians can actually write songs but it can also be the easy way for not-so-good musicians. you can be a completely amateur guitar player who knows about three chords all you need is some distortion pedals and a squealing woman and there you go. your woman does not even need to sing well because putting some echo effect on her voice during production and mastering will make it sound good and different anyway. i am not saying that this is the exact case with my bloody valentine but i feel like it is a bit true for them as well. i mean for the first 4 tracks on loveless i kind of felt like i was listening to a very old washing machine doing its very last tumble drying it is pretty much like some guys going to a practice room and just playing around with their distortion pedals without making any sense. when you sleep is finally a real song the only song i actually liked on this album and after it the album gets okay all the other tracks are actual songs and not just making noise but still they are songs that i do not like. i have also noticed that most of the better songs are sung by kevin shields so it kind of feels like he gave his weaker ones to bilinda to sing but that might just be my thinking maybe i have met too many aholes with too much ego and i keep seeing them everywhere. still even though all that i have written here are from my very subjective point of view i just still do not feel like this album would be such an essential thing from an objective point of view. the sound and production is very good but other than that i honestly do not understand all the hype because the way it sounds it is just the garnish and the actual content is not that good. therefore i just cannot rate it any better than 25 stars.,0
the best noise i have ever heard.,0
i will admit that beyond it is utterly lifeless shapeless composure lies some sort of mysterious hidden glint which probably gives it the popularity on a site that promotes the deep over the easily digested. however for someone who has no real desire to give such a monotonous album 772 listens it just falls into the rest of their discography trashy uninspired shoegaze.,0
i really like the powerful groove of only shallow and ethereal beauty of what you want but the rest of the record seems too boring as for my ears. yes i understand how ifluental and acclaimed this record is but i measure music with my feelings not with histirical meaning of record or number of five-star reviews on this site. one day i will definitely return to loveless but now only two and a half stars.,0
i can see why people who listened to this as a teenager love this album. it brims with melancholy. but hearing it for the first time as an adult i do not find it that interesting. the drone effect had been done before see velvet underground. if this is the first album to blend droning fuzz guitar with catchy upbeat melodies then it has some historical value. but early smashing pumpkins did it better and more interestingly. a track or two at a time is enjoyable but the album as a whole is too repetitive.,0
i ordered this because of all the accolades i have read on here similar to the reason why i wanted to hear televisions marquee moon. i got to say i cannot believe anyone likes this crap or can call it music. i cannot understand a single vocal all the way through this thing and outside of the guitar riff in only shallow i hear almost no music just a bunch of feedback and fuzz. in the same vein of sonic youth this is music for people who cannot play instruments and just give you feedback like a motherfucker and call it art. probably the most overrated album on this entire website. i do not know that an album has ever dissapointed me more than this collosal piece of shit. i am going to make a note to disregard the opinions of the people who like this album,0
really bad- not my cup of tea. this album sounds like a bunch of noise that goes nowhere. you cannot hear one word of the vocals but that was done on purpose. on the other hand the melodies can be heard through all of the garbage.,0
unique mix of noise and melody. but something is different from my taste. is not this too sweet especially lyrics?,0
i find the record worth alone for sometimes. i like only swallow a lot as well and most of the songs to be honest. it might not be your favorite record but it has something to offer i believe. sometimes is definitely the peak of this album.,0
vocals are fucking awful... but music is decent. i think this album is overrated. 90s music have better bands...,0
despite its acclaim and influence this fails to take advantage of the shoegaze sound in the way that its followers were able to. it has all the aesthetics that laid the groundwork for shoegaze extensive use of pedal effects dreamy wall of sound etc but it adheres to poppy song structures far too much. just about the only thing that can be appreciated about this album is its influence. if you want to hear shoegaze being achieved to its full potential you will find it in most of the other pioneering bands more so than this bland album.,0
i had written a review of this which wondered to what degree the reason for its supposed greatness was the way everything was tightly edited together leaving no gaps. i wondered if a quick fiddle to make it sound less like a radio 1 breakfast show might considerably reduce the albums stature and i thought but did not say that if an album could be reduced so easily it perhaps was not much of an album to start with. thinking about this now though it seems a clearly ludicrous line of thought. the album is about immersion asking for gaps between tracks is like asking rothko to paint miniatures. i wish to acknowledge this error. i also wish to state that while i do not think there can be any reasonable doubt that mbvs best song is you made me realise loveless contains many fine things which i am sure are detailed quite adequately in reviews on this website and elsewhere. but i wish to further state that it is a record you live with and i have not. still.,0
one day...,0
the whole of loveless has a fuzzy washed out sound seemingly tailor-made for closing eyes and getting lost inside of. when you sleep has a few hooks but by-and-large the foundation of the loveless journey is this fuzzy hypnotic dreamscape that slowly ambles forth. the lyrics are buried so deeply down inside the fuzz that they are almost inaudible the fragile vocals of shields seem like a ghost or something trying to shimmer out and communicate from the netherworld through all the warbling. you could say that if anything it is just a bit overcooked with all this additive buzzy sound but as the album gets into side b this load lightens. from come in alone which floats away in a kind of divine head-swimming trance the songs become much more cushioned and dreamy. the sighing hush of vocals across the grating buzz in sometimes harks forward to smashing pumpkins quite possibly an influence on billy corgan. the warbled wispy and airy blown a wish gets balanced up by the slightly noisier what you want and soon but the vocal remains ghostly and fragile. the sound of loveless is all about the ebb and flow of that weirdly distorted ambiance the building and building of that warm glowing fuzzwash of guitar and shrieky noise that rises and falls throughout. layer upon layer of sampled bits are overlaid sounding something like a hundred broken tape recorders groaning around and around while buzzed-out guitars drone over the top and dainty vocals coo through the middle. since it is submerged under so many layers of electric pack-makeup i do understand why some people just do not get loveless. it tends to get lost within itself and meanders over and over as though in a trance. i confess it took a long time for me to get it just one day without warning it just clicked and i started to sway internally and glaze-out. the success of this for you the listener probably requires you to be in right the mood for glazing out to its distorted hypnosis but the perseverance is rewarded.,0
what is the big deal? it sounds like the pixies but highly overproduced. the noise drones go on too long and the vocals are mediocre. it is a lot like film incidental music run amok.,0
very over-rated album.. for me it seems like a mess of sounds and i could barely hear some songs with my earphones without getting irritated. the only good thing about this album is that i think it influenced a lot of bands like m83 and other indie acts which perfected the style and they sound way better and freshier than this noisy band.,0
more tuneful than i imagined it would be. although i cannot say i love it and some of the tracks disappear in the fuzziness i do like songs like only shallow and when you sleep.,0
i hear steve urkels annoying fucking dinosaur slippers in the first track i must be losing it. not a bad album really but not what i am into at the moment. i will just take your words that its the greatest album ever made in all of eternity. whatever.....,0
giving another view of how noise can penetrate into pop structurethe perfectionist kevin shields found the way to bend his guitars and the atmosphere around him with this great record a fine example of sound exploration.,0
at first i was like  but then... i was still like ,0
it just gets old. it is highly original. lo-fi noise and shoegaze with indiscernable vocals. slosh pop. literally sounds like somebody got way too messed up and then went into the studio. i would love to hear this record with a slightly more straightforward mix just to compare. i will take lush- gala over this any day. closing track is amazing however!,0
8 listens in i just do not get it. it is vaguely pleasant music mostly but i see nothing here that screams 5 stars nothing here that says listen to me and not one of many other albums that exist. maybe i just need to listen to it high.,0
loveless mag musikhistorisch von groer relevanz sein und tatschlich prgten sie das genre shoegaze markant slowdive aber brauchen bei ihrem zwei jahre spter produziertem souvlaki keine groen umschweife um my bloody valentine in den schatten zu stellen. sehr viel krawall und liberale geruschkulissen finden sich auf loveless aber zu welchem zweck? quirlige dissonanz betubt die ohren dahinter verbirgt sich eine sehr seichte langweilige nachricht. to here knows when zum beispiel bedient sich an einer wand die aus lautstrke und undefinierbarem krach besteht. die elemente passen nicht zusammen und klar mssen sie auch nicht aber hier ist das entdecken de weil es nichts zu entdecken gibt. ich wnschte die band wre hier von ihrem verwaschenen kauderwelsch abgewichen denn loomer und insbesondere when you sleep legen hervorragende anstze zu tage. das konstrukt ist geheimnisvoll das flimmern und rauschen ldt ein den verborgenen kern zu suchen. beim rest gilt potential leider vergeudet.,0
boring overrated.,0
i am sorry to interrupt your 5 star festival in here but i do not like this album. maybe i am taking the wrong drugs maybe i had the wrong girlfriends maybe i just do not know good music. but 25 stars nonetheless officially revisited 31.may 2013  25 -- 25 still not feeling it,0
not the best album of 1991 by a longshot but a good album indeed. this is one of those albums that is about half great and half boring. when the band develop strong melodies to go along with the unique atmosphere they create the results are great. unfortunately about half of the tracks seem to lack a strong melody to carry them and without the melody they just become sort of aimless and boring. highlights only shallow when you sleep come in alone i only said sometimes.,0
loveless gibt als ganzes ein recht erbrmliches bild ab. gewiss einige passagen wirken weniger strend als andere. vor allem dann wenn die langeweile durch totalausflle wie das unglaublich nervige when you sleep unterbrochen wird und man sich hinterher an der formlosigkeit des nchsten songs erfreuen kann. der jmmerliche gesang sowie eine produktion die angeblich unwahrscheinlich aufwndig sein soll schlussendlich aber einfach in hhenlastiges rauschen mndet stehen jedem hrvergngen i am wege. der entscheidende punkt ist aber dass die songs einfach nicht gut sind. dazu kommt noch diese leck-mich-am-arsch-attitde die scheinbar in den 90ern so angesagt war auf mich aber eher peinlich wirkt. my bloody valentine geben sich sehr viel mhe um desinteressiert zu wirken. leider ist es nicht so dass sie diesen widerspruch auch nur ansatzweise in irgendetwas spannendes ummnzen knnten.,0
all too often this is the only shoegaze album some people own and more often still this is talked up as the definitive shoegaze release. bollocks to both. what is good about this album? well it is got the gaze. if you want to hear the sound of people staring far too intently at effects pedals and making the sound from their guitars swirl in all kinds of maddening directions this has the goods. it is got pleasant melodies captured in a vortex of haze and distortion so you cannot go too far wrong. what is not so good? well as much as sheilds tried the productions a bit underwhelming and turns the swirly gaze into more of a formless mush than entrancing waves of guitar noises. plus some of the songs just are not that good. simple as that. it goes on too long for what it is. in essence loveless is the sound of people with not a lot to say and too many effects pedals with which to say it. personally i think it is a terrible shame this decent and enjoyable but flawed album is held up as the finest shoegaze album instead of nowhere by ride or shot forth self living by medicine. if you want to know how good the gaze can be grab nowhere or shot forth self living.,0
oh how i was once excited for this album. i remember it clearly hearing the background story reading up on the record and then acquiring a copy though rather strangely for me i do not remember where from. listening to it.. actually at first i thought my excitement was well justified with the first loping riff of only shallow and everything it brought with it i was hopeful of having really found a new favourite and not having just been suckered in by an interesting story. i think this enthusiasm even persisted dimly through loomer and touched before to here knows when kicked me in the literal nuts and stole my proverbial dinner money. i know the objection to the line i am toeing here - that i do not get it. i will be the first to admit that yes i do not get it. i love cacophonous music i love absurd guitar noise i love slow and hazy song structures i seem to love everything that is in loveless only loveless is rubbish. i am listening to it right now - my one-last-listen-before-reviewing - and i really cannot wait for it to be over. partly because it is much the same mess that bored me near to tears last time i gave it a chance and partly because i know that the latter half of soon will again be the only part of the record beyond the opening track i find slightly likable. there is a lot i like about loveless - the relentless attention to detail utter artistic absorption the refusal of compromise and the dedication to massive guitars - but unfortunately the music itself is not a part of it.,0
so you add layers of noise to some catchy love songs the result is an all-time guitar classic right? the color is part black part pink i only care about the pinkcatchy part sing the lyrics as though they were by coldplay. but the noisedark part of this album also touches my isolated heart sometimes. to here knows when was often heard on radio which introduced and accustomed me to the blurry soundscape. warning if you relate a lot to this music find it unbelievably beautiful then you are in trouble you must really be loveless.,0
this album really only deserves  but gets a bonus  for inspiring billy corgan. it is easy to hear the influence on the pumpkins it is also easy to hear how important execution is.,0
there has never been an album more overrated than this one in the history of rym. that said it is a good album. ...just not 4.22 good. jesus.,0
i like this.,0
what happened? i used to like this album a lot. now i just think it is mostly quite bland with some good bits here and there. oddly though you made me realise-ep still works wonders on me.,0
i have never been a huge my bloody valentine fan. i mean i understand their place in musical history and i obviously appreciate the fact that they basically invented shoegaze but i have always thought that you do not necessarily have to like a band to appreciate what they have done. there is clearly no doubt how influential this album is but i cannot really say that it is an album that i find myself listening to very often. the album definitely has it is good moments. opener only shallow is definitely a highlight as is when you sleep sometimes blown a wish and album closer soon. then there are songs such as to here knows when i only said and what you want that just seem to meander on and on without actually doing anything interesting. the album has definitely grown on me in recent years which is why i hesitated to rate for so long. about a year ago i probably would have rated it a 2.5 or a low 3 but i think it is grown on me enough to earn a solid 3.5. overall a cool album that is earned it is place in music history but just not an album that is as great as it is significance suggests. not to mention that i actually think i like is not anything a tad more.,0
ok then i will give it 25 stars although my ears would say 2... i honestly do not understand why people love this album so much...,0
how i hate myself for not liking this record! god i really tried! 1991 was such a great year in pop music. nirvanas nevermind talk talks laughing stock rhcps bloodsugarsexmagik sepulturas arise soundgardens badmotorfinger massive attacks blue lines primal screams screamadelica crowded houses woodface mr. bungles debut teenage fanclubs bandwagonesque matthew sweets girlfriend prongs prove you wrong... i could go on and i love them all. but this one simply does not click for me as open as i am to experimental sounds. while hearing it you get the feeling that a vinyl record is playing and someone puts a finger on it from time to time in order to slow it down. it seems that almost everybody loves the idea but to me it is simply annoying. however the album opens with what i consider one of the best singles of all times - the gloriously beautiful only shallow. that is what forces me to give the album one solitary and shining star. sorry everybody.,0
a disappointment. excellent songs hampered by a terrible mix and tedious tape-speed wankery.,0
a great mellow album with walls and walls of textured guitar sounds in such a spacey serene atmosphere. with amazing subdued vocals. one of my favorite shoegaze albums,0
another grower it would appear. though it has taken a painfully long time for the rating to climb to three stars. still too many moments that put me off but coming back to it over the years has paid dividends in some unexpected places. give it another decade or so and we might have a genuine five star article on our hands.,0
good work but a bit overrated some tracks are redundant and the best songs sounds like the cocteau twins reworked with studio tricks.,0
this album is certainly full of great texture and effects. it is that and the layered sound that usually garners this album praise. but it is not layered at all! there is always a distinct sound up in the front dominating all the others. and the sound that is in the front of the mix is usually repeated umpteen times lessening the impact of the noise and potential beauty.,0
all this is is a guitar genius who knows his way around guitar effects and self-indulgences for a great amount of time trying to perfect rythmatic noise only to come up with only glimpses of inspiration but in essence really wasting the ears off of the listener most of the time 95 of the time. our own band wrote a wall of sound better than any track on this album. go ahead and judge for yourself. it is found at ourstage.com the song to search for is where lies the meaning? by the way this album is so much on the side of treble it kept giving me headaches. a deep rich bass in the background surely would have helped. this album just simply overkills anything it might have had going for it.,0
sonic wallpaper. really only the first song only shallow stands out as a song of note. the rest is a collection of 4-minute drone sessions. and though it is not unpleasant for the most part with its dreamy warped sonic aura it does not really evolve into what we know as a song. i know it is cool to love this album i like it but it is not one i am going to put on repeat. sounds like a dream. an ethereal cassette tape that got left out in the sun too long. best songs only shallow come in alone,0
i will agree that this album has some very unique sounds that i have never heard before but that does not make it the best album of 1991. it is not better than nevermind i am going to.,0
i do not get this album and sadly i do not have the time to try to get it. only shallow when you sleep and soon save this album from being totally unlistenable at the first listenings.,0
meh,0
fuzzy warm feeling that only hurts a little.,0
i am going to the music and arrangements are pretty in places without ever being exceptional. i reckon there are plenty of musicians who could do this or something very similar if they tried. the chord progressions and arrangements are really quite simple extensions of the rock genre. i rather strongly suspect that the lyrics are disguised in part because they are not strong and sound more enticing as things you might be hearing through a wall. i agree that the overall feel is pleasant but for me it is little more than that. i agree that only shallow is a stand-out track but for me the album does not sustain. i do not wish to damn this recording it is ok. but a classic? i do not think so. the emperors new clothes come to mind...,0
only shallow is incredible. besides that i really do not see what everyone is talking about. i have listened to loveless dozens of times and it still has not clicked. to me it just sounds dated.,0
not as good as most people say. its good. not as good as daydream nation or other classic albums of the noiserock genre,0
sometime when i was not looking this record entered the critical canon as one of the great all-time records possibly the great all-time record. ok. i accept that. some records in the canon i outright reject- forever changes is an awful record and will always be an awful record. this one though if you tell me it is a great record i will not argue with you. remember in the 90s those stereogram things? you were supposed to look and look and look at them and then you would see some great picture or something. i still believe them to be some vast fraud or conspiracy possibly an attempt to brainwash the people of earth. there was no picture 3-d or 2-d. there were random blobs of color strewn over the page that was all. this is how i view loveless. every time i listen to the album which i do once every couple of years i am struck by its startling similarity to obnoxious tuneless bilge. this i have come to accept is probably a perceptual deficiency on my part. one day i could listen to it and say oh now i get it this is a really great album! it is happened in the past. i spent years for instance hating the velvet underground who i now think are a pretty neat rock and roll combo. one day i could love this record but not today. today it is bilge. that is not to say it is the same record it was the last time i heard it- today they have run the album through a tape deck with faulty azimuth so sometimes it plays back too fast. boards of canada do this a lot. except when they do it the results sound good. this sounds not so much like boards of canada as it does some really bad-sounding bootlegs. i have one led zeppelin bootleg where they do a lengthy run-through of no quarter and it wobbles exactly like loveless does. it is more annoying on the zeppelin bootleg but then again no quarter is a song i would actually want to hear in the first place. when you do not have anything resembling a melody it does not matter if it is played at the right speed or not. but like i said there is probably something to this record. all you guys who say it is brilliant you are probably right and i probably just do not get it. maybe i never will get it and if i do not well i am okay with that. i am pretty sure i can still manage to live a well-adjusted happy and emotionally fulfilled life anyway.,0
i really understand the praise this albumg gets. i am sure it sounded so new back then but today the vocals sound way too quiet and like their mixed backwards. the instrumental parts are atmospheric and the breaks are melodious. like i said really good for that time but i am afraid if this album would have been released today it would just be another vague badly mixed chaotic and overlooked indie rock album.,0
man i was really really disapointed of this record. first i love shoegaze. dreamy melodies interpreted through loud effects filled guitars. it is probably the perfect genre but this record is just blah. first the effects are mainly just guitar distortion and not that great guitar disortion like second rate bob mould trebly guitar distortion. second only half of these songs have good melodies. now i enjoy those songs but the rest eh i could do away with.,0
you must have a head problem to like this! ear mud in industrial proportions! ,0
i am crazy about the shoegaze influences especially the jesus and mary chain and dinosaur jr. but loveless is too self-consciously abstract for its own good. in particular the constant inclusion of bright almost childlike melodies mixed in with the darker guitar ambiance is not a satisfying match. as a result the tracks strike me as half-baked and shallow lacking in emotional resonance. it is a pretty good cd though and the closing track soon was my favorite but even that seemed to be an unfinished and misplaced effort to conclude a series of songs that appear to be striving for a major artistic statement. oh well. at least i can always go back to darklands or where you been whenever i need to scratch my noise rock itch.,0
ok i have listened to this a little more than when it was originally reviewed but i still believe it is not all its cracked up to be. there are some great hooks and melodies and some of the most unique sounds i have heard like for instance sometimes is one of the most beautiful things i have listened to...for about 2 minutes. which brings back the main problem with the album - almost every song on the album can be described as going on a bit. whenever a song latches a decent hook or is accustomed with a great sound it either relies on that same hook or just drags the same noises throughout the entire song without really getting anywhere. maybe i am missing the point entirely or this is in fact the actual appeal of the album.,0
this album actually reminds me to cocteau twins but a little more boring. i expected something different when i tried this band. the melodies and atmosphere is quite good but not really my cup of tea.,0
mbv are a band who sound better on paper than on record. i think this album is ok but it is not a masterpiece . to be honest to me kevin shields comes across as a bit of an arsehole or a stoner - or both. i personally think that the album is over-rated like i said it is ok but i do not think it is genius. mind you i have never really listened to this record very loud through proper speakers so maybe i have missed something. they are a cool name to drop in indie circles and most reviews you come across anywhere are positive but....still no i do not rate this album.,0
ethereal dream pop meets noise rock. basically remove all the balls from noise rock and you get this. good god this is boring.,0
the vocals are annoying. the whole thing sounds like it is badly recorded or something. yeah captain hipster it is lo-fi!!1!!11. i am the one who does not understand the genius here probably.,0
sorry i could never figure out the hype on this. i will concede that only shallow is brilliant especially as an album opener. but beyond that things are pretty average. i like ethereal style vocals but on this they are just kind of mushy and actually step on what would be good songs.,0
a million fing reviews and every single one of  them forgets to mention the albums almost-complete lack of song dynamics. i know i know it is all about the soundz but still i will take slowdives souvlaki over this baby almost any day of the week. admittedly that album is clearly influenced by loveless and music in the 90s and 00s would not be as much fun if white collegiate kids did not discover texture is important in music as well. still alternating verses and choruses in the most formulaic way possible does not lend a song dynamics. fennesz plus forty seven degrees 56 37 minus sixteen degrees 51 08 is a more enthralling listen when it comes to awesome pure sound exactly because it eschews those trappings consisting just of sounds drifting in and out. one more thing the single star does not represent my hatred for this album in a perfect world it would be a 2.5 or 3 just... stop humping it. it is static goddammit in both senses of the word.,0
loveless is a unique record an experiment that rendered something different and as it turned out for my bloody valentine impossible to follow. unless you fetishize newness however - and apparently there are many who do - uniqueness does not necessarily equate with greatness. loveless is less an album of songs than a series of sonic textures thanks in particular to the experimental nature of the album but also thanks to the mix that muddies the vocals on every track to such an extent that the lyrics are incomprehensible throughout. i found it unlistenable the first time through but gritted my teeth and found the grains of something worthwhile. mostly however this album is of interest as a historical oddity as its influence can be heard in other popular but more accessible music of the early 1990s especially early smashing pumpkins.,0
i have tried to make myself love this cd over and over but i just cannot. i do not hate it but it did not change my life like so many people said it would. i do not think kevin shields is a genius. i think he came up with interesting sounds but hardly a genius. washy howling guitar? give me jesus and mary chain any day of the week.,0
soon is ok yes i did make it to the end! but apart from that i am afraid that i really do not get this... ,0
i used to be uncertain. now i am not sure. that is good. i guess.,0
fuzzy warm and pink. it always puts a smile on my face whilst the music is melting. a near flawless pop record. all the nonsense that you have heard about it is true.,0
why this made no. 1 for 1991 is just beyond me. an utterly boring record that recalls the hype around the jesus  mary chains psychocandy. anything but groundbreaking.,0
with the release of m b v i revisited both is not anything and loveless after never having been very excited by either one of them. i found that is not anything was better than i remembered. loveless however offers little to my ears nothing in fact before when you sleep. i generally like the second half of the album but find nothing too special outside of when you sleep and blown a wish.,0
mah...forse non ho ascoltato questo album al momento giusto forse non ho provato abbastanza...ma a me questo album non  rimasto nel cuore. spesso suona come un esercizio stilistico pi che come espressione dellanima che necessita di fuoriuscire.,0
it seems i missed the window of opportunity to appreciate this album for it is originality and beauty...listening for the first time nearly twenty years after it is original conception i come away hearing only the polished followers the genre became saturated in that emulated and perpetuated every aspect of this once unique sound. it is cold and seemingly purposefully uninviting. i somehow have managed to enjoy the record on occasion however so i cannot rate any lower than 3.,0
failed goth band decides to play with effects pedals while overusing the tremolo bar. results are moderately interesting. alas their noisy wankery is nothing adrian belew did not already do within a more tuneful and musical context back in the 80s. file under gimmicky curio.,0
para m est algo sobrevalorado el disco. no por la produccin que me parece excelente para el estilo que busca el grupo ni tampoco por las letras las cuales son de una melancola emotiva que le pone a uno los pelos de punta. lo que le falta es algo ms de chicha de riqueza creativa. todos esas lastimosas lneas de bajo esas melodas esos susurros esa distorsin terminan por cansar como si fuera siempre la misma cancin. eso s como idea es brillante nada ms empezar los noventa coge este grupo y sienta las bases de lo que sera el resto de la dcada. slo por eso merece ms de una escucha.,0
i was excited when i first listened to this album. i thought that behind the wall of noise i first heard there would be great music that would show itself after several listenings. i am now very surprised over the high ratings and great reviews. i find the music behind the noise quite boring and it gives me little..... shoegazing? i do not think so. some parts here and there are beautiful a couple of the tracks are so-so but all in all it is nothing new and interesting behind the noise.,0
i like this album about as much as i thought that i would which is to say that i liked it about 3.5 stars worth. you can really hear where a lot of bands that came after took a lot of inspiration from this album. sometimes it makes me think of smashing pumpkins. other times it reminds me of first album-veruca salt. i consider both of these similarities to be good things so they obviously contribute to my overall enjoyment of this album. if the whole album was as melodic and accomplished as say the first track only shallow i would have given this album 4 stars. unfortunately there are tracks such as to here knows when which i consider to be just short of noise. not being a big fan of avart-garde noise rock these tracks cannot help but remove some of the relative effectiveness of the whole album. i see why this is such a highly regarded album but it does not have enough of what i look for to be one of my faves.,0
i may have approached this album wrong. i come from a background where elaborate sonicscapes triumph over tranquility not that there is anything wrong with the latter. i can more than appreciate honest attempts at creating something unique and a deep atmosphere is a guarenteed pull-me-in. i approached this album with expectations of greatness. what i got was disappointment. the album offers a crash course in how to remedy sloppy musicianship. the first thing you will learn is that if you cannot play an instrument then why should you try to sing well? all that will do is isolate good from bad highlighting the deficiencies. instead keep the vocal range to a single octave at the most. this will arouse feelings of disinterest because it is well known that apathy is the only way to connect to todays sic youth. lesson two deals with muddy productions. the basic idea here is that if you crank up the treble discard the bass and drench everything in unnecessary levels of echo and chorus your music will becoming nothing more than an incoherent mess of garbled noise and rhythmic static. oh and that rhythm section? yeah just loop a basic rock beat. no one will notice. but it does not end there! you can take further courses such as playing music in three chords and marketing 101 for the ever-important strategies to truly connect with your audience. enrollment ensures guaranteed success so that you too can becoming just another mindless drone cashing in on whatever past or present fad sweeps across our impressionable youth. makes me sick.,0
nice album very dreamy and hazy. recommended for fans of cocteau twins.,0
interesting lyrics hidden beneath a wall of incredibly messy guitar... noise hardly even chords let alone riffs. can barely hear the vocals but they never bother to sing any interesting melodies anyway. not that i have not tried to take in this album but slowdive beat them at their own game with the massively superior souvlaki. i do not care who did what first slowie have better musicianship and could actually write melodies and riffs. loveless sounds like it has none at all. overrated as hell. at least try ride instead but the real masters were slowdive - no question.,0
i am exceptionally cool for owning this album but there is a spot reserved in hell for me because i like shit that is influenced by it way better.,0
this album has some good lyrics very good lyrics as the surrealist i only said but music they played was horrible so noisy unclear. and we are rating music if i want lyrics i read poems of course if besides good music there is good poetry so much better i mean do your thing. in fact it seems they did not want to transfer an idea a feeling the girls voice is covered by an innoportune guitar and you cannot listen what she sings althought you do not want to hear what she sings althought you do not care hearing what she sings and that guitars music never never never sounds well. i think that is a kind of description of shoegaze.,0
this album has a perfect flow. the songs goes into each other in a perfect way. unfortunately the music is not good. poor rhythms hardly any melody and a constant humming weird soundnoise in the background makes me lose my interest every time i listen to it and i have listened to it carefully at least 5 or 6 times but it just will not grow on me. i guess i just do not like shoegaze.,0
greatly overrated but massively influential as much for the idea of the aesthetic they were going for on this album as the thing in-itself.,0
ok i admit i underestimated this. i heard it hated it and put it away. when i picked it up again i actually started to like some of the techniques used. it is still no five-star thingy but it sure is a decent album.,0
four tries and i think i am done at least for now. i thought maybe this was the type of album you have to give a few listens to appriciate. it is gotten worse every time. boring repetitive and at times annoying. i can imagine it being good if i am in the right mood. not completely useless as there is some occasional beauty in the noise. just not nearly enough.,0
i will give this more listens to be sure. there must be something interesting going on amid all this distorted noise.,0
no veo la obra maestra por ningn lado. es un prodigio de produccin y suena original pero a m el disco no me transporta a ningn sitio no me transmite nada y las canciones no me parecen nada del otro mundo. no encuentro nada malo en este trabajo tampoco hay nada que me incite a volver a escucharlo. con todo le voy dando oportunidades ao tras ao esperando ver la luz algn da algo tendr si lo adoran aficionados de indudable criterio. de momento no es para m tal vez nunca lo disfrute tampoco me preocupa. me gustan only shallow when you sleep come in alone. moderadamente.,0
one of the 3 worst records i have ever heard in my life. and i am old enough to have listened to thousands of records.thank god i found a buyer  allthough it felt like cheating him ,0
this is a very good - and very overrated - record. however relative to the hype little in terms of substance could possibly stand up. yeah i understand the historical significance to the shoegaze sound and certainly kevin shields is one of the most emulated albeit poorly guitarists out there but try and evaluate this album on the merits not on the hype.,0
first listen....wtf. read more reviews.... 2nd listen....no really wtf? went away no intention of coming back. came across some more references.. and reviews ah well let me try again. 3rd listen......hey i like that and that and that. hmmmm.....i like it quite alot. odd record but very likable.,0
well it is pretty. but it is also almost completely unmemorable. not boring not at all...just not memorable. maybe if there were something to sink in to besides squalling noise with occasional direction i could appreciate it a bit more.,0
i wonder how many of these positive reviews are influenced by pitchfork. why is this album regarded to be so good i do not get it. i think the pumpkins do a better job when it comes to distorted layered sound anyway.,0
gives me a headache. there might actually be music behind the feedback but i cannot even tell if it is good or not.,0
the crevices exploding with hidden noises the 14 layered guitar tracks rolling over each other creating pockets of melody that crackle unexpectedly over seamless vocals the endless reverb the complicated studio design the artistically gilded premise beauty versus revulsion love versus sex art versus obscenity...it is still a painfully boring record.,0
only shallow! oh yeah they abs. rite bout their music. sluggish relaxed uncertain unfocused record. it is not so bad by itself. but the matter is that i know a host of bands that worship mbv and would like to sound exactly like k.shields and co. because everithing you need is weak indi fem- vocal three dirty chord and feedback - the more feedback the better! a lot of indi crap bands all over the world waste their and my time plaing fucking shoegaze. and i hate this album more and more.,0
once you get used to the fuzzy sound of the album you can hear the chords and the melodies in all their glory and most of them are good. the problem is that some of these tracks are too repetitive. i never find myself being kept interested for the duration of the album because the band do not quite mix things up enough. it is fine on only shallow which i liked from the first time i heard it because it is a 419 track which in practice is well below four minutes because of the ambience at the end or come in alone which again is just under four minutes in length. however there are several tracks on here which exceed five minutes in length. i do not have a short attention span and i am not saying that longbad but invariably a longer track on this album means a couple of minutes of repetition at the end. soon starts off wonderfully the chord progressions and the vocals fit really well and i get that dreamy feeling from it but the track is almost seven minutes and by the end there is nothing interesting going on. loveless is still good but it is not great.,0
i probably coulda given this a 3 12 rating but the sheer utter disappointment with this album hits hard. definitely on of the most overrated albums of all time. the first three songs sound almost exactly the same and while many people may enjoy the soothing voices of the singers it sounds like elevator music to me. the guitar is pretty nice but it does not make up for the other flaws in this album. i guess one more good point about this album would be that it sounds really cool when put to an old silent movie called speedy. the second time i gave this album a try i got bored around the third song turned on the tv to tmc and started watching the movie only to find that the repetitive music matched up perfectly with the constant screwball antics on the screen. that was pretty cool but on its own this record is not very good,0
i just do not get the hype. i would pick anything slowdive ever did over this bloated mess.,0
not really sure what all the fuss is about,0
how could mbv have taken 3 years to complete this album? you better appreciate it and give it a fair chance this was their final album it supposedly destroyed them. like a painter that cannot complete his masterpiece and keeps on painting over layers and layers on canvas until it is a complete mess that is loveless. layers and layers of white noise covering and fogging otherwise well crafted songs in the smashing pumpkins slash radiohead mould. i can understand that loveless sends certain rymers into total euphoria it is certainly very unique and possibly beautiful. still it just does not do it for me. the supposed angelic sections are so bleached out it hardly exists. the vocals are a whisper-like drawl that never reaches any potential. this is all due to layers and layers of distorted guitars washing out all the colourand leaving everything red yes in my minds eye i can only see red. i am sure that if you can break through the white noise and get inside the melting pot that is the heart of loveless a treasure chest awaits like no other.patience may succeed but personally i know that i am not going any further with this experience. regardless of this reality it is still not a bad listen and i do not regret it is place in my collection.,0
i hardly give such a low rating but here i have to go out on a limb and say this is not good music. the chainsaw buzz from my neigbours garage sounds better than this.,0
i have tried oh how i have tried. words like seminal landmark classic are thrown at this album and possibly rightly so but all i hear is a crappy drum machine and incomprehensible lyrics buried beneath wave upon wave of guitar feedback. maybe that is the point i do not know. parts of it are quite pretty but maybe that is me trying too hard to like it.,0
i bought this when it first came out due in large part to the glowing reviews i do not get it. the album just plain sucks. swervedriver just blows them away. wow i can make noise with my guitar. that must make me good. but that in the end is all it is noise.,0
i have to say i was rather disappointed in this album. i had such high hopes. especially after hearing blown a wish still my pick for the albums best song on an online radio station. however the rest of the album really does not sound much like that song. it is still good just in blown a wish they find a way to make the noise and chaos blend together with the music to create a very dreamy bubblegum pop mixture. the rest of the album does not quite have that kick.,0
after having listened to it over the span of a couple of years i simply do not get the hype surrounding this album. the only song off it that remotely grabbed me was only shallow.,0
i think i actually under-rate ok computer if anything. that is bonkers right? it is been my favourite album for over two decades now - but that right there is exactly the problem. i heard it when i was 15 and it was maybe the fourth or fifth album of any kind i would ever truly paid attention to front-to-back and the first that was not essentially forced upon me by my parents or general peer pressure at school. it was the first time i would ever decided it might be worth actually trying out music for real and the very first album i ever landed on just so happened to be the best one? nah. it is far too convenient. i keep side-eyeing it uneasily when i see it sitting at the top of my favourite albums list. surely the rush of hearing it now cannot be the same as it was when i was hearing it as a teenager. surely at least one of the 3500 albums i have heard since has surpassed it. right?! and yet i have been having this thought repeatedly for well over a decade now and every time i come back to it i am absolutely blown away. i think to myself that surely paranoid android will not have that power when the shock of the multi-part song structure has worn off. surely subterranean homesick alien will not sound as profoundly spacious distant and yearning as it did back in those long distant days when it was my favourite song. surely exit music for a film will not still send those shivers flying up my spine. surely let down will not be so emotionally overwhelming. surely climbing up the walls will not still feel so terrifying. surely at some point no surprises will stop sounding so damn pretty and feeling so damn desolate. surely lucky will not soar so high. and yet every time i go back and check i find that all of those things are true and more. the other songs have only grown in my estimation since the tourist has stopped feeling like one of the weak points here and screamed all the way up to becoming one of my favourite songs in their catalogue and the surprising coldness of electioneering has really started to draw me in. it just somehow keeps getting better every time i hear it. so yes it turns out that by total fluke my first ever attempt to find a favourite album was the only one i ever needed and as much as i have loved spending so long trying to find something better and as much as i will probably continue to do so for as long as i am alive it is probably a fruitless endeavour. ok computer man. what a fucking album. so yeah. apologies if you are one of the many many people who favourited the previous version of this review but it was a complete load of shite and frankly you should have known better.,1
i get why radiohead rub a lot of people the wrong way. a lot of people just find them too cold and thom yorke has one of those voices that will drive a lot of people batty. they are also such an enormously acclaimed band that a little backlash was just inevitable. plus even i find their image as the self-ordained darkest weirdest band on earth a little excessive and i gave this album five stars! oh and did i mentioned how widely imitated they are? we live in a world where bands like coldplay and muse and keane diluted this sound into something a little more radio-friendly and made buckets of money off it. in cases like that you could not be blamed if you wonder does the original stand up after all? well i have got some nitpicks of my own. electioneering is not quite the headbangers extravaganza it clearly wants to be great guitars at the end though while fitter happier still sounds a little too edgy-90s for my liking is not there a nine inch nails b-side called a pig in a cage on antibiotics?. if i ever bust this score down to a 4.5 it is probably because they put these two right in a row. my opinion on exit music for a film depends on my mood sometimes i get caught up in the gothic drama of the whole thing and other times it just seems like a whole lot of overheated nothing. in other words i am not quite ready to go out and say ok computer is a perfect album. i would have said that at one point a less mature point in my life indeed but you know how it is. you get older and that album you loved so much shows a few of its rough edges. yet the best songs on this album really are as good as you have heard. pretty much all of them. i would hesitate to call subterranean homesick alien a masterpiece but its subtly tricky arrangement and much-needed humor make it an important addition to the album. you have just got to lighten things up sometimes because this record gets heavy. sometimes in terms of the guitars they tear some shit up in the loud parts of paranoid android but more in terms of the emotions. this album is one negative trip my friends. android lurches between queasy acoustic guitars wall-rattling riffs and goth-prog creepiness in brilliant fashion - think how happiness is a warm gun constantly keeps you off your kilter but the release is much different. climbing up the walls plunges you deep into some horror-movie shit with huge drums processed vocals yorke let us some bloodcurdling screams loose and some of greenwoods earliest string arrangements. even no surprises which musically is almost mccartney-esque in its mellow lull has some dark fucking lyrics. radiohead plunges you into a dark and alienating world with this album is what i am saying here. normally this kind of relentless grimness puts me off pretty sure i have raised this complaint about pink floyd but radiohead knows their way around a song. the tunes i mentioned above are spectacularly well-crafted. androids multipart structure is no mere grab bag - each part not only flows with but builds onto the one before it. climbing up the walls earns its explosive ending - the fireworks is always just waiting there so when they finally hit they feel like the most natural development. no surprises is plenty lovely but with an ominous edge. and hey there is more where that came from. take my personal favorite let down. this ones best known for its third verse where thom yorke duets with himself. it is a soaring and spectacular moment the album at its most emotional and yearning and it gets there by way of a tense but lovely keyboard solo. even before all that kicks in check out the blend of icy guitars and ringo-style drums that move the verses and choruses. there is in short a real attention to sonic detail here. the details why i never minded the beatles lift on karma police. not only does the piano part fit in with the songs soft chorus beautifully but the textures in the coda are pure radiohead. those five are the biggies for most people but the cool thing about this album is there is a lot going on here. somehow i have made it alll this way without even mentioning the opener airbag. shame on me! what a great song. the atmospheric guitar sprinkles of keyboards and cello hook might not surprise you but the song is also kind of funky. great beat here and a great bassline too. radioheads rhythm section does not get a lot of attention but they deserve a lot of credit for shaping their sound. they do not get as much attention on the closer the waltzing tourist but that is also a feast of sound. check out the dreamy country guitars the mellotron choir even the little ding of a triangle at the end. while we are in the albums closing stretch i have always really enjoyed lucky. yorkes soaring vocal and greenwoods most balls-out bombastic guitar make a great pair on this one. i guess my only question is what to do about those two weaker tracks. they had some great material in the vaults - the trip-hoppy instrumental meeting in the aisle would have made a much better transition than fitter happier and pearly rocks much better than electioneering. i also wish polyethylene had found a home on an album - to my ears it is one of radioheads better tracks with a big tonal shift i have always really loved. still we got the album we got. not one of those albums where every song is a total gem but an album whose high points are so dazzling i cannot help but go the full five.,1
i would like to think i am good about not letting the wider critical world affect my own amateur reviews. rather than saying this or that is overrated or underrated or making parallels about my opinions vs everyone elses i prefer looking at things within my own bubble - after all it is my opinion that matters the most to my listening habits and i imagine someone would read my thoughts to learn what i personally think. with some records that is harder than others. there is a number of albums that are so universal that they form a part of our collective consciousness even if we do not care about them albums which have been discussed and analysed so often and in such great detail due to their importance and place in the canon that there is literally nothing new to say. most of the time i can still comfortably get by. enough time has passed from the beatles pink floyd led zeppelin and other sacred cows that the old canon narratives are actively being argued against while new ones are established and there is a wider variety of opinions challenging the old classics and somewhere between those lines i am able to place my own opinion without feeling like i am better off just linking to the relevant wikipedia section. not to mention that for most iconic records i am too much of a natural contrarian to hold them in the highest of pedestals in the first place. ok computer is a curveball for me in this regard. it is a landmark album and even i agree with that - to a degree that it feels like an actual challenge to start dissecting it apart. you are not going to find unique angles to view this album through from me is what i am saying. it is my generations sgt peppers and i am saying that without a single ounce of hyperbole. it is a cultural milestone that has affected so much of the other music i enjoy inspired countless other musicians and shifted genre trends. to this day it causes so much discussion analysis and over-analysis that we are all absolutely sick of it. we can all recite from memory the story of thom yorke  co becoming increasingly fatigued by society and music industry at the same time as they felt their ambitions limited by their early sound and in turn exploding in fame and finding themselves even more fatigued through the record they made to channel all of that frustration and ambition through. and if you do not you are pretending - because ok computer transcends any genre barrier knowledge if you are even remotely passionate about music. it is omnipresent.you cannot avoid it no matter how much you want. even now ok computer is a prime example of a band reaching for their lofty ambitions and realising the breadth of their own skill set and taking a boundary-breaking leap within their own path. comparing pablo honey and the bends to it is practically pointless because the change is so vast there is enough hints on both albums particularly the bends to point out where ok computer came from but the narrative is loose the familiarities superficial at best. ok computer effectively re-introduces radiohead from scratch the urban angst of grunge-era guitar walls has evolved into pre-millennial apathy and depression and the band are musically thinking outside their own box to the point that the tropes introduced here are now aspects the band are forever associated with. not just that but they are also elements that are echoed within the particular kind of rock music that followed in ok computers wake. you can trace a direct genealogy from it to nearly everything that has been happening in indie and alternative rock since. you think of angst-laden introspective guitars and you will be able to trace them here. like all the very best progenitors ok computer still sounds like its own thing even now. despite how many times its tricks have been repeated there is nothing that combines them quite like here. part of it is due to radioheads own uniqueness the very specific traits its members have yorkes falsetto wailing oft imitated never bettered and characteristic lyrical style most obviously but also jonny greenwoods flourishes inspired by modern classical and phil selways razor-sharp drumming. there is also the neurotic flair that ok computer is powered by that has never really been captured by its followers in quite this way. yorke was very obviously not having a good time the band as a whole found inspiration through it and traces of it are all over the album whether it is the resigned exhaustion of no surprises the anger of electioneering or the downright crippling paranoia of climbing up the walls. ok computer frequently sounds like its suffocating within its own four walls creeping closer together only to push them periodically away to reveal something hopeful for a fleeting moment. ok computer is not radioheads best album. i understand why paranoid android is iconic and as admirable as its multi-suite progression is i have never seen it as a particular discography highlight and its first part towers above the others to the point i wish it was the blueprint for the entire song and electioneering meanwhile is basically an attempt to re-do r.e.m.s ignoreland but quite simply not as good. they are good but neither are songs i could say lifts the album for me. i also just think that radiohead started to get really interesting after they decided to deconstruct and reassemble themselves in ok computers aftermath which is when their skitterish neuroses found a sound that perfectly suited it. but i understand why it is such a revered album and it would not need a great stretch to make me into a true believer too. after all many of their best songs are here. let down is in some days is in fact the best song they ever wrote period making the world-weary desire to disappear into the most gorgeous thing when in its final minutes the song jumps off a cliff and soars into the sunset on the wings of its layered vocal parts and intensifying instrumental section. karma police is one of radioheads most haunting but bottles a quietly churning rage and it twists that dagger deeper with each new section it offers. the finale for exit music for a film is like that bottled rage finally breaking through igniting into a wall of distressed sound of the like the bands rarely tried since. the final stretch of the album is also probably one of the all-time best closing runs climbing up the walls makes an orchestral section sound distressingly claustrophobic it is phenomenal by the way the simple but endlessly beautiful no surprises is the other big contender for the bands best song and in fact its quiet but powerful fragility is what converted me into thinking there is something to this band after all lucky is as atmospheric a rock anthem as the band would ever do and the second verses introduction of the simple keyboard texture is one of my pet favourite moments of simple instrumental additions making a real difference and the tourist achingly floats in its own world giving the paranoia of the album a calm breathe out in the end. ok computer has throughout its length hit with some big punches and overall high quality miserablist rock but it concludes like a real iconic moment in music history. furthermore ok computer still feels just as relevant as it always was as well maybe even moreso in this modern society that is growing more cynical and fatigued by the month. it is just as evocative and its songs are still impactful proving their strengths despite every single one of them having been picked to their bones over the years including the fitter happier interlude which genuinely has its own important slot in the overall flow and greater thematics of the album. ok computer is a truly great album often stunningly so and very audibly a moment where a band realised their own capabilities towards greatness and made them a reality. that so many people in the world agree with me a lot of them way more passionately than i do is a happy coincidence. this is all to say that out of all the albums in my collection ok computer is probably the one record i find the most difficult to discuss but you are in luck in a matter of seconds you can find thousands of reviews articles and in-depth essays that say what i would likely think anyway. this must be what beatles fans feel like. it is not one of my personal all-time greats but its place among the canon is more than justified.,1
there are radiohead devotees like there were once bowie devotees. those who find the unexpected change in direction exciting rather than disconcerting. those who discover a little more meaning in it all than the rest of us think necessary to enquire into. it is an admirable tradition that goes back at least as far as the beatles. ok computer draws a little from the beatles as from pink floyd and even u2. the 60s 70s and 80s...man if you could put those big names into a successful mix then you are on to a winner! ok computer does just that with a sound production that does justice to its prestigious forerunners. quintessential art-rock song based but sufficiently removed from any stifling grunge influence and liberated by a laissez-faire neo-progressive experimentalism it is no wonder that this is their most celebrated release - it reaches back to earlier generations rather than alienating them. there is no denying that radioheads instincts for grand theatrics - combining biting self-analysis and semi-bombastic instrumental innovation - are artistically convincing and yorkes vocal style probably summed up a generation of angst-ridden youngsters. what is more the music can scale some frightening heights carefully crafted to be sure yet with a natural band feel. but under closer scrutiny some of the patching up can be a little irritating. where songs are not arranged to segue seamlessly they often resort to silly effects driven bridges. and not every song stands up some are given artificial support that is not always successfully integrated - pulling out all the stops begins to sound like damage limitation. on climbing up the walls it seems to work splendidly airbag too goes full tilt with breath-taking confidence but a song like lucky seems too slight to be dressed up that way likewise let down and electioneering. fortunately subterranean homesick blues and paranoid android more than make up. but if the album is only slightly over-ambitious that is not a crime and to be fair all the songs hang together and add up to one seminal rock album...perhaps one of the last in this age of downloading and playlisting. but i do miss something to make me smile - rather than just nod - and it is odd perhaps that something so downbeat could have made such an impression....much like floyd in the 70s i suppose taking themselves so depressingly seriously. and i miss a strong back-beat or a funky jazz for all its dazzle and guile. as always it comes down to personal tastes. this album means an awful lot to a great many people. it is easy to see why.,1
i wrote a shining excellent review for this album and then the browser went nuts froze and somehow logged me out and the review was destroyed. i am still pissed the fuck off just having to redo it all you know how much crap i write. but in spite of this it is almost horribly fitting. because that is what ok computer is kind of about. and what is that? well first what do you think might be the leading reason for a sort of revitalization in rock music with this year? because it is undeniably the most alive year in the genre since basically 1991 easily. not that anything was wrong with the 90s i hear tell electronic music from this time was strong. and 91-96? the golden age of hip-hop right there some of the finest material ever dropped. but for rock? kind of a dry time not bad or anything just....dry. stagnate. heck the last time rock was this dry was ages ago the mid-70s and that was much briefer and 1975 kicked ass anyway. so this is easily the biggest drought in the genres history so far. sure part of the reason may have been how many awesome bands died or fell off prematurely right before it mbv janes addiction slint guns n roses stone roses pixies. but mostly it felt strapped for direction and ideas only post-rock truly excited and even that only really starts taking off with 97 anyway. 97 solved the identity crisis because rock finally realized what was going on in the world around it and how to start putting that into music. around 97 if you are old enough to recall was when the digital age really started to happened when information economy swung in for real a new technological and social world began. lots of bands started processing that and the rewards were plenty. and no one better synthesized it into a sound than radiohead did with ok computer. except this is not the good sides of all that not the super sleek and clean aesthetics that graced much of the late 90s art world. radiohead became obsessed with the dark sides the strange furious frustrations not with humans like the hippies and punks before them but with the claustrophobia and plastic of the inanimate around us. this is in the lyrics and very much in the songs. the music here is wonderful stuff a complete realization not only of everything they would been playing at since the start but of every single new thing they tried out too. their old obsession with slow burning songs on bends did not all the way convince me in it is execution. in fact one of the main things that made me weary of them from far off was all their slow songs the bends did not make me unscared either. but here that side of them is made real doubtlessly great and worth it is time. the more anthemic and energetic songs are astounding works here. with all the simple britpop anthems running around at the time including virtually the whole of be here now it is easy to forget what a truly exciting and forward thinking rock anthem would sound like. you know one that is not overly indebted to some past form of music. and in comes songs like airbag karma police and climbing up the walls sounding like nothing else before them...and sweeping you away in their sad grandeur. the mood of the album is worth noting too. it is at turns hopeful and despairing sometimes seemingly at the same time. it is an odd sort of melancholy that seems almost disengaged in it is own fate. the melodies are beautifully sad like the smiths before them but yorke sees no strut in his breed of misery like morrissey did. instead it is almost resigned and passive about crumbling world very millennial in a way. that music video of thom yorke calmly singing in a tube as water fills up around him is pretty damn apt i would say would not you? and due to all this ok computer is perhaps still the one record modern rock lives in the shadow of. not nevermind. nevermind cast it is shadow deep into the 00s but mostly on irrelevant crap it is real legacy sadly being teenage angst has paid off well rather than any meaningful cultural imprint aside from killing off much of the old mainstream anyway. instead it is ok computer that has informed subsequent rock mostly the brits with bands like muse and coldplay but also north americans like interpol and arcade fire. this is 2000s music being born here far more important than people give it credit for and people give it a ton of credit as is. rating 5 highlights airbag paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls,1

there are certain classics that will no matter what be known as an epitome of classical standard for all the future of that particular art. for example all movie fans will forever idolize the godfather. all literature-obsessed bodies will continue to glorify shakespeare. all fans of cartoons will find solace in the flintstones and scooby-doo. there is something wonderful about music though and it is that there is not just one kind of music. i know there also is not just one kind of movie but...a movie is a movie. it is the same experience no matter what it may be about. you sit down you watch something it means something the end. music is not quite like that. sure we sit down we listen to something it means something the end. but...music also manages to utilize tens upon hundreds of elements in one song where it then throws them into a giant melting pot for mixing and then finally dump the contents onto the person who is experiencing the music a.k.a. the listener. it is only fair to conclude that each and every song is felt and experienced differently by each and every individual. to be fair to the movies and books and cartoons of the world all of which i hold dear to my heart as well i know that each of the aforementioned things applies to all forms of art. it seems though that with music we are given a much more vague and self-reliant hold on exactly how to enjoy it. when you sit down and watch a tv show all you need is a little bit of attention your eyes to the screen and a comfy place to sit. if you have all of these the only thing that can keep you from enjoying said program is an intellectual difference. with music it requires much more work on the listeners part you need to focus on the sounds listen to the words form the atmosphere that the song will carry and remain in an alert and sound environment at least when you are still getting used to a particular piece of music. this is one of the reasons that i turn to music to quench my artistic thirsts. radiohead in particular does not help the average listener. quite the contrary actually when i first heard ok computer i was compelled to turn it off because i was so out of my element upon hearing it for the first time. that was years ago now and i am glad that i continued to give this band and more importantly this album chances. what starts out as a very attention-needing listening session ok computer manages to lay all of its cards out on the table in a very easy fashion once you have gotten to know it. it is almost like the really interesting cool kid who does not trust anybody almost everybody knows who they are and many people who have become friends with that person find them to be incredible but...at the same time it is a really difficult task to get yourself that high in this persons graces. ok computer flat out rejected me and my tastes the first time i heard it and i was so discouraged that i did not go back for well over a year. i just took it that radiohead was not for me. i later could not handle all of the hype for this band and decided that i would jam this thing into my head no matter what. some say that forcing something on yourself is a bad thing but i learned that statement to be a false one. as i will say with many of the albums featured in my favorites list i like to listen to my albums as a whole. this does happen to be one of those records where i do not like to single out songs but...that is the wonderful thing about this album i can. i can actually listen to this as a whole but then go on to pick out and listen to individual songs that are of particularly noteworthy quality. some say that this would throw off the album consistency but i do not find that true for ok computer. radiohead paints a wonderful picture on almost every track that this album has to offer i say almost due to two filler tracks airbag which everyone loves and i find to be a whiny mess and fitter happier a crappy and creepy interlude of sorts. analyzing just a few of these key songs i would like to point your attentions to what many myself included consider radioheads very own stairway to heaven paranoid android. this was the first radiohead song i ever heard and i did not care for it the first time i heard it. i decided i would let it grow on me though and i am satisfied with this song. yeah it is a great song even if there are a few better songs from this album anyway. subterranean homesick alien earned its high graces from me when i decided to play it on repeat one night for 65 times. i slept through most of those sixty-five listens but the theme is forever embedded into my conscious and subconscious mind. let down earns itself as the most beautiful song of the album and karma police gets the award for the catchiest. still one song will always reign over the others for me and that song is climbing up the walls. this is a contender for my favorite radiohead song ever packing in some of the strongest emotional themes that has ever been touched in alternative rock fear insanity and the unknown. while these are not the only songs noteworthy of mentioning from ok computer i feel that i would only be bringing down the review and wasting your times mentioning more such as electioneerings muse-esque qualities or exit music for a films wonderful sentiments okay i slipped up a bit there. radiohead would not go on to do another rock-based album in a long time after this one even this album was not all rock-based. the bends serves as the final truly rock album by radiohead and i really wish they had balanced their future works out as well as they did here. maybe that is why this is considered by many to be radioheads blackwater park. who knows? all i know is that each song manages to speak for itself. this is a quality that i find many bands struggle with mr. yorke demonstrates the proper way to do such things. just how this album managed to evolve my tastes is something that i can barely begin to describe. if i started i would probably break some sort of hidden character limit that rym has for reviews. with all that i have said i would like to close my thoughts gently with a lovely line from frenchies review as you can see it is nearly impossible to actually describe and review the music contained on this record. it is just everything. the meaning of life may well be hidden in there somewhere. this album is simply one of the greatest and easiest listening experiences for any person who has the patience and will to achieve such zen. i encourage everybody to not give up when they hear this...it is far too amazing to give up on. there are certain classics that will no matter what be known as an epitome of classical standard for all the future of that particular art and ok computer has went down as that very standard that all experimental and alternative rock follows. have a lovely day everybody.,1
let us say you could buy this album for around 12. you want to know if it is worth it right? here is what i would pay for each track considering singles go for about 1-2 on itunes or other retailers airbag at least 20 paranoid android 35 sub alien probably 20 exit music 30 let down 35 karma police 15 fitter happier 10 electioneering 15 climbing up the walls 25 no surprises 20 lucky 25 the tourist 25 total over 280. this may seem ridiculous but this album is seriously worth 20-30 others. it will last you a lifetime. i have owned it for 15 years now and i still hear something newexciting every few listens. it is an album you will never grow tired of. ok computer is so good that i often see it in record stores and get tempted to buy it again. again! just to have that amazing sense of discovery. that feeling and knowledge that i would stumbled upon something as perfect as this. and you have.,1
en octubre de 1997 compr mi copia de ok computer. no haba sido uno de esos discos que a esa edad quera con muchas ansias como s lo fu el mellon collie por nombrar uno que no me d tanta vergenza pero s que se gan un lugar especial en mi coleccin adems fue de esos cds que era edicin britnica y que vendan en las discotiendas antes de que la distribuidora nacional en este caso emi colombia lanzara su propia edicin por lo tanto el libro que traa estaba como tena que ser de hecho proteg el borde con cinta transparente no uno de esos acordeones de papel ms delgado. el track 7 estaba sin remedio rayado para la grabadora aiwa que haba comprado un ao atrs y es que era obvio en aquel entonces que no tena nada de interesante fitter happier por lo que la saltaba todos los das seguidos que me la pasaba sintonizado a ok computer. muchas veces cuando recin estaba conociendo a radiohead deca que lo bueno aqu era casi todo pero lo que vala la pena era paranoid android y un poco karma police o hasta exit music for a film. compr el cd porque muchas revistas lo mencionaban como uno de los grandes acontecimientos del ao y rotaban el video aquel de esos dos personajes animados con unas aventuras en sitios que hoy ya no me parecen tan descabellados. de hecho no haba visto nunca a thom yorke por lo que cuando o estas canciones lo imagin muy distinto. las i amgenes que me produca este disco eran de un futuro no tan alejado brillante pero monotono a diferencia de hoy que oyndolo percibo ese presente de 1997 despojndose de los ltimos rastros de romanticismo que le quedaban a la humanidad. todo esto porque qu cosa nueva se puede decir de ok computer que no salga sobrando? es un disco excelente que hoy no pierde vigencia y de los pocos que luego de la dcada de los setentas mostraron que musicalmente haba an cosas que hacer. entre esos viajes en el tiempo que el arte te permite hacer ahora puedo decir que sin duda este disco se le puede poner al lado de las reconocidas obras maestras de los padres del rock. quiz pueda agregar ciertos peros nuevos - electioneering te recuerda las canciones ms poderosas del the bends pero no les alcanza a hacer ni media sombra. - airbag es una buena cancin y seguro de las ms alegres en una melanclica discografa pero viendo el resto del repertorio una mejor cancin podra abrir el lbum. eso s cumple con la labor de introducirte desde un principio en la irona de ese absurdo mundo desolado en el que rebotan afilados riffs y todo se desborona entre bits y lgrimas. - the tourist tiene una hermosa meloda casi acutica que alcanza el nivel de xtasis necesario para finalizar un disco as pero s dependiendo del estado de nimo en que te encuentres puede ser mgica o aburridora. - hagamos de cuenta que paranoid android no es tanto una sola gran idea para cancin y ms varias ideas sencillas muy bien ejecutadas para referirse a un concepto amplio. si algo pudiera no tener es cierto encanto que provocase empata general. de ah que a muchos les caiga tan mal porque no les llega. eso s lo instrumental es bestial y el concepto en esos das funcionaba mientras que hoy no tanto porque perdimos parte del miedo apocalptico de los aos noventa. - climbing up the walls suena mucho a todas las dems bandas que resonaban por aquellos das s oasis. - acabo de leer una comparacin entre radiohead y muse mientras escuchaba el disco. el simple hecho de traer a colacin que muchos aprendieron aqu como deba sonar el rock y lo ejecutaron de la forma barata es una confirmacin de lo grande de esta banda pero tambin es referente de actos musicales que deberan ser olvidados. s que poco de lo que acabo de decir no es tan cierto y que he tenido que rebuscar para querer sugerir alguna mejora. y seguramente puedo aportar agregando lo que hoy he revalorado oyendo ok computer estoy analizndolo cancin por cancin y no intentndolo conceptualmente. o sea la idea ya est ms que asimilada no hay nada que discutir. lo que queda es redescubrir dentro de esos instantes nuevos que est generando la msica en este momento. hoy ok computer tal y como unos pocos discos es una obra que se debe asimilar as para poder encontrarle si acaso algn defecto o algo nuevo que no se haya dicho. con todo esto hoy s que de toda la msica que oa en 1997 ok computer es la nica que persiste en mi memoria no slo como referente en cuanto a sonido sino tambin en cuanto a calidad.,1
this album changed rock and roll. it put the unmistakable classic sound of 60s-80s sock in a blender and mixed in the technological flavors and paranoia of the coming century. in this way it can be seen as the bridge between classic and modern rock a bridge that exists at a heightened level between each of its sides. more so than any other album every song is a work of genius and can be listened to for endless hours. from airbag to the tourist the album flows seamlessly instilling an atmosphere of passionate complexity as well as moments of intimate melancholy. this is not a sunny album - if anything it is stormy. it forces you to listen and you do not really even realize why your eyes are wet until the last ding of the tourist. any music lover who does not own this album is a fraud.,1
it feels like everyone who loves ok computer has a story to tell. some stories are more romanticised than others but everyone who loves this album either seems to recall the first time they listened to it the moment they fell in love with it or the reasons why it has had such a profound and lasting effect on them and i am not too much different. to start with the album basically changed my entire perception of what music was capable of. it made me truly understand what music was capable of in pretty much all aspects but it was the first time i took into account track listings and sequencing and how an album with overall cohesion themes a vision and having something to say could really be something special. of course along with the best album ever tag hyperbolic praise gets bestowed upon it. this album and the bands music in general means a lot to people and people make their feelings known. as well as hyperbolic praise a backlash of hate from people who deem it to be overrated. even though it is generally considered to be a masterpiece like with most things people will hold an opinion to the contrary. but this is the kind of album that means so much to me on a personal level that i really do not care about any of the acclaim adoration backlash hate or whatever else that comes along with it. even though with an album as adored as this the people that do not see anything in it are in the minority i just do not care about their opinion i just let them have it. i obviously do not understand opinions that differ from mine because i hear something different. i think the main factor in this being one of the best albums ever is because it is incredibly personal. it is thematically strong these are not just mere vapid or vacuous songs about nothing they have an incredibly strong thematic centre and the subject matters of each song resonates with me. it is an existentialist album and one that feels incredibly personal. ok computer is about alienation isolation disassociation loneliness paranoia and a whole host of other things. but to start with when i listened to it aged 15 i just loved the album. at first unlike many other peoples stories the album did not have a profound impact on my life. at least not straight away. before i would heard this i originally listened to and owned the bends and pablo honey and i loved them both - this was back when all i listened to was rock and guitar based music and nothing else. i am not sure why i decided to listen to those two albums before ok computer because i knew ok computer was the most famous radiohead album and the album often cited as the bands crowning achievement but i somehow did anyway. so after listening to the bands first two albums for a while i decided to listen to ok computer. the first thing that really struck me about the album was just how much better it was than anything guitar based i would ever heard before. before it meant something and really resonated with me on an emotional level it just sounded so ridiculously good. it immediately made me dislike pablo honey. it just blew it out of the water in every single way. when i listened to ok computer i also was listening to a lot of oasis it blew them out the water. it basically blew everything guitar-based from the 90s away. i remember not knowing what the album was about or why it was so great i just knew it was something pretty damn special. it did not completely change my music taste when i listened to it 15 years of age i still listened to an awful lot of crap before it and after it but this definitely shaped my music taste in the future. when i first listened to ok computer the lyrical content was too cryptic for me to even begin to understand. then we skip forward a few years. every time i listen to this album now all i hear is alienation social anxiety and a real personal struggle brought on by technological advances and how they change the way people interact with others and the isolation it brings. so the album starts and airbag comes on. with airbag you have a strangely refreshing song - at least on the surface. a song about escaping death a new lease of life being born again and being saved. though it may be steeped in sarcasm you can never quite tell but every time i listen to it i always wonder if there has ever been an opener quite like it and it always makes me feel incredibly uplifted. then immediately after you have paranoid android which has got to be a contender as one of the greatest songs ever written though not actually my favourite on the album. you have a song that i believe heavily deals with technology bringing out social anxiety in people - the yuppies networking. the panic the vomit. but i also get the feeling it is a song about revenge and living with the guilt of your actions. - i am paranoid but not an android. a song about fearing for your safety while all the time remaining true to yourself and taking comfort in that. the third song on the album is subterranean homesick alien is a song which i just think is about alienation and wanting to escape. i think there is vague nods and science fiction influences on the album and as a fan of things like blade runner that is only a good thing. i was never quite sure about this songs meaning. whether the alien was yourself and it is a metaphor for how disassociated you are. whether it is a literal extraterrestrial encounter. whether it is what aliens would think about human beings human nature and human behaviour if they could look down and see us from a distance. but i finally decided it was a song that is just escapism i wish that they would swoop down in a country lane late at night when i am driving. take me on board their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it. being so disassociated you just want something radically different. next you have exit music for a film. every time i listen to it all i can think about is romeo and juliet. but again it is just wanting to escape. the fifth song is the best song on the album and is a contender for the best song ever written recorded and performed. let down is about as perfect as music can possibly get. beautiful haunting affecting powerful thematically dense lyrically insightful. it is my favourite song on the album which says an awful lot. i have always thought that it was both about modern transport and how uneasy it makes you but i think it is mainly about frank kafkas metamorphosis. in fact it is more of a continuation of that. in kafkas novel you have the protagonist who is a man turned insect and everyone is repulsed by him. feeling great despair and pain he gives up and dies alone. when let down starts it really is one of the most uplifting songs on the album musically. the sweet melody comes in the uplifting guitar starts but it is juxtaposed with the most emotionally devastating and despondent lyrics. it is such a melancholic bittersweet and beautiful song. i think unlike in metamorphosis he is not looking for pity do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel and despite great misery and despair there is a glimmer of hope that one day it will all be okay. with let down you have one of the best songs ever but what follows is almost just as good. karma police is a song that is incredibly bitter scathing and angry. it is obviously about karma. people who have done wrong they will get what is coming to them. i think this is one of the most weirdly catchy songs on the album as well every time the for a minute there i lost myself bit comes in my heart skips a beat. then after the best run of songs in music you have the song that grinds everything to an abrupt halt. it is most definitely the most controversial part of the entire album and even people who love all of the 11 other songs have hated this one. fitter happier is a song i have grown to really appreciate but it is kind of difficult to like it. it is just short of two minutes. it is a song that people think is where thom yorke went full pretense on the album but i have grown to really appreciate it. it is a song that has a robotic voice talking over a very simple ominous and haunting piano melody that seems to get more and more desperate and full of despair as it goes on. the robotic voice is talking about all the things you are supposed to do as a healthy well functioning human being. it is about how all those values can be an oppressive thing and if you are not doing all of the things you are meant to you will be medicated into being a lifeless zombie on antidepressants. not a song as such but one of the most haunting moments on the album and i love it for that. after the slow ominous haunting quality of fitter happier the band launch into one of the loudest and powerful songs on the album in electioneering. again it is another form of juxtaposition on the album that works so well. it sounds like the bends-era radiohead much more than any other song on the album. it is a song that is about politicians and their devious nature and how they are morally bankrupt and will do anything to succeed and get your vote. as well as a critique of voodoo economics which is about right wing corporate greed and cutting taxes for the rich. it is one of my least favourite songs on the album but it is still great. next up you have climbing up the walls. one of the most insidious and sinister songs on the album that is musically and lyrically incredibly dark and bleak. i think it is a song about mental disorders but i am not too sure. every time i listen to the album and it comes on i always feel incredibly uneasy. after climbing up the walls you have one of my most personally affecting songs on the album. no surprises which i have always considered to be one of the most existential and despairing songs on the album that is about how that conformist life spoken about in fitter happier slowly destroys you and how disaffected you feel because of it. so disaffected in fact that suicide and death would be a release a handshake of carbon monoxide. i think the best line in the song and one of the best lyrics on the album is one i can relate to - a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you. with the album coming to an end you would be forgiven for thinking that after such amazing songs it would taper off but the last two songs are incredible. lucky is a song that i think is thematically linked to airbag a song about escaping death. i think it is one of the most upbeat songs on the album in its lyrics where it is the only sign of any glimmer of hope. lastly the tourist. the closer of the album one of my least favourite songs on the album. but they decided to close it on a quieter more reflective note. it is about being a tourist and observing how other tourists are rushed and harried and it is just another critique of society. while we are in a busy money orientated consumerist society we should slow down and think about where we will really going and the reasons why. in conclusion ok computer is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it contains so many songs that i think are as good as music can get. as i said earlier when i first listened to the album at the age of 15 it just sounded good to me but did not really mean anything. but in the 6 years i have been listening to it since it has of course become incredibly important to me and has had a profound impact on my life. i can recall the exact moment when this album had a profound impact on me i was around 19 years of age and i was listening to it in the car driving somewhere. i was only half listening to it but i was leaning up against the car window and i was sort of phased out. i was there in body but definitely not in mind. suddenly an overwhelming feeling came over me. i felt nauseous strangely claustrophobic and incredibly vulnerable. but it was all okay because ok computer was there and radiohead felt exactly the same way. transport motorways and tramlines. some moments on ok computer are spine tingling other moments are disturbing and some moments are simply beautiful. this is truly one of my favourite albums of all time.,1
the knowledge that you love radiohead is like a foundation of reality a supporting wall of your little house in the uncaring wilderness of the void. that some people can listen to ok computer and not be awestruck dumbstruck thunderstruck and possibly several other hitherto-unnamed kinds of struck or even worse actively dislike it is a reminder that sometimes other people seem to inhabit an entirely separate and unfathomable plain of existence. thom yorkes voice is perfect - it is the kind of voice that makes me amazed to be human and incredibly grateful that a person was born who could sing these specific words in such a way. the songwriting on every track is beyond belief. melodic to the extremest extreme. when you realise that let down which tucked into the middle part of the album could be likened to stonehenge being surrounded by the great pyramids and the parthenon and yet is still miles ahead of pretty much anything any other band was doing at the time and has done since you begin to comprehend the greatness of this album.,1
you have heard it all before so i will just point out what is important for me  in no particular order 1. the tourist  the albums worst song  is also the most fitting closer for the album in the way that the repeated hey man slow down  idiot slow down links the album cyclically with its opener airbags in a fast german car i am amazed that i survived  an airbag saved my life. apparently the band spent an entire day deciding on the finalized tracklist and it really shows not just in the opener and closer but the whole thing really works as a cohesive unit in a way that the bends definitely does not. 2. ten years from now the band would extract one of the best parts of the tourist  the melody at the 023 mark  and recycle it for nude the you go to hell line and expand on it. this is neither here nor there i just thought i would point that out. 3. lucky is one of the two songs off ok computer that could be criticized for its generic-ness. without ed obriens injection of atmosphere we would essentially be listening to some of the easiest-to-learn guitar chords. that being said there is one key moment that actively excites me when thom yorke takes a pause after it is going to be and belts out a glorious day. people often stereotype radioheads songs as cynical music made for cynics  that one moment is a rebuttal  an affirmation of life and a testament that it is worth living. 4. the movement to catharsis within exit music for a film is another such example. 5. electioneering - great title - is the other of the two songs off ok computer that could be criticized for its generic-ness but people who think it should have been cut off the album forget that this is a much-needed burst of energy on an album that mostly deals with the melodramatic. 6. fitter happier everyone is favorite spanking child on the album manages to take the beatles revolution 9 and condense it into 2-minutes worth. it is terrifying both in the background piano that is playing from within a locked room in your house and the concept that human behaviors have become the equivalent to how we input commands into a computer turning us into a pig in a cage on antibiotics. even if you hated the song did it really waste all that much of your time being 2 minutes and all? did it really? did not think so. 7. actually my least favorite track on the album is subterranean homesick alien not because it is bad but because it is a summer-y song on a winter-y album. but there is one key moment - the quiet surroundings when thom yorke sings but i would be alright at the 255 mark and onwards and how things go completely chaotic at the 317 mark i am just uptight. 8. when i first heard the smashing pumpkins today it was a revelation to me - putting sad lyrics to a song in a major key though upon further exploration in music this juxtaposition is not all that rare but still. let down is a huge improvement on that. in a comparison between the two tracks thom yorke is more abstract in what he is saying  what exactly does the repeated you will know where you are with actually mean is anyones best guess - but that is a mantra if i have ever heard one. there is not anything as obvious as corgans wrist-slashing pink ribbon scars line though every line in radioheads best ballad yes it makes both fake plastic trees and street spirit fade out look like the stuff of soap operas in comparison is heavy-hitting. it is an effect that is produced by the way thom yorke moves from vague topics transport  motorways and tramlines to more direct ones the emptiest of feelings and clinging onto bottles or the second verses wings twitch  legs are going to do not get sentimental  it always ends up drivel. furthermore his falsetto in the songs last stretch is the most best use of falsetto i have ever heard. 9. people who accuse radiohead has being unimaginative by offering the fact that they lifted the chord progression from sexy sadie for the bridge need to learn that there are better things to drink than haterade. yes that is been well-documented but it is also a the least-interesting part of that song the rare case of a song whose verses are catchier to say the least than the choruses if i were to break it down into parts and b constitutes such a small section of the song that i am left thinking who cares? the thing about radiohead is that they have managed to assimilate their influences into a package that is accessible for people who might not have enjoyed those influences otherwise. in an extreme example you have got people wearing beatles shirts and listening to aphex twin songs. anyway i do not have much to say about karma police except that if you are a novel guitarist you might want to start there it contains practically every chord you will ever need do not try to start with paranoid android like i did  you will hate yourself and your roommates will hate you too. 10. also that ending of karma police manages to wonderfully capture that paranoid feeling you get when on certain jaunts with mary jane. the same goes for how inhuman yorke sounds on climbing up the walls. 11. people bring up normal multipartite standards when praising paranoid android the beatles happiness is a warm gun or stupidly queens bohemian rhapsody but their similarities end with the use of the adjective. both of those tracks were uplifting paranoid android is cathartic. there are plenty of things to note within it the riff in the second part of the song starting at the 157 mark that secures its place as one of the most badass riffs ever thom yorkes whines at the 212 mark that manage to actually convey the paranoia that he sang about in the first part of the song how thom yorkes most visceral performance in his you do not remember you do not remember why do not you remember my name? off with his head man off with his head man why will not he remember my name i guess he does oooooooooooooooyeahhhhhhh leads right into jonny greenwoods equally visceral solo at the 304 mark the amount of counterpoint especially in the slow-tempo part within the song that could make johann sebastian bach shit his pants the way there is a really subtle chord change in the lone acoustic strum under thom yorkes final lines god loves his children that signals the whole band to come crashing back in with the assaulting riff with thom yorkes yeah! music! 12. it is unfortunate that it is been overlooked thanks to everyone rushing to hear the main attractions paranoid android let down karma police no surprises but airbag is fantastic and much more than just an opener for paranoid android those beeps were a fantastic idea. speaking of the albums cohesiveness again parlophone clearly understood how essential those beeps were to paranoid android that they kept them for the 2008 compilation radiohead the best of. unfortunately since they were proceeded by just there was something lost in the translation  airbag and paranoid android go together like pasta and pasta sauce. no airbag is a wonderful testament to brian enos work listen to how some of phil selways drums are replaced by lasers  the same effect was done on talking heads thank you for sending me an angel and how much music has changed since. the whole thing sounds like it was fed into a computer one of the few times this is meant as a compliment from how incredibly dense the song is the the cellos phrasing is deliberate cut but that barely registers because of how it interchanges with the guitar - colin greenwoods bass guitar similarly creeps in and out of earshot but sounds rush to fill the void. scrolling up and down  i am born again? that predated the facebook era by almost a decade. 13. for me and tons of others this is the album equivalent of a gateway drug. after connecting with it it became a mission to listen to the rest of radioheads discography listen to radioheads influences and then listen to anything that might bear passing resemblance to radiohead. but like drugs every time i think i am done with it i put it on again and i realize how much i love every second of it. and sometimes i get mad at the album because of how i winded up writing reviews for music on the internet that no ones going to read instead of getting a move on my life and then i get sort of bummed and i put on ok computer and it does not help me get un-bummed. it still sounds amazing while it is doing that though. a,1
where music begins and ends for me.,1
i am just patiently waiting for something else to take the top spot here at rym. but who can angst harder than tom york? time will tell.,1
this album is fucking incredible. while many may accuse radiohead of making dry music or even poser shit i cannot identify with any of these viewpoints. ok computer does an amazing job of making a soundtrack for the pains of modern life. it is not the most innovative album ever made sure but it is undoubtedly unique and incredibly rewarding to listen to. from the more popular songs such as airbag paranoid android karma police and no surprises to less-known gems like exit music and climbing up the walls the delivery is just perfect. it is music that washes over you.,1
well shit this just became a 5-star. typical. you know what the worst thing about consensus is? it makes the people who do not agree with the consensus act like pricks. i do not mean that in a complainer is always wrong sort of way i mean it in a this has a reputation for being the best ever and i do not think it is which makes me unique and special sort of way. the poster child for this is citizen kane which has suffered from this possibly more than anything else ever has ever. if i had a penny for every time i have heard yeah it is pretty good not the best film ever then i would have enough pennies to buy each of them a history of film college class and teach them why people say it is. it drives me flatout insane. on this site the equivalent in terms of artist is the beatles. one side maintains that they are the greatest band to ever lay hands on instruments and the other side maintains that they are completely overrated and their popularity is more due to a cult of personality than any sort of actual musical or creative prowess. as a huge beatles fan who maintains that they were incredibly flawed i get to sit in the middle and feel superior to both groups which is grand. in terms of albums the citizen kane of music right now is ok computer and i will admit guilt in adopting the exact same stance that annoys me so much about the citizen kane naysayers. i kept a certain sense of well they are very good i can see why people like it but it is not really the best album ever is it? no much better stuff is out there and the masses just will not appreciate it. what a pity. also with the other sentiment of radiohead are good but they have not made the album they are capable of yet. well call me wrong on both counts. this is incredible and this is their album. kid a could soon get there as well. jesus even the songs i do not particularly like on this have their moments. karma police is not my favourite but his voice on the chorus later on the way it shakes as it hits the high notes. jesus fucking christ. fitter happier somehow works. why does it work? it is a fucking 2 minute sound collage thing in the middle of a fucking alt rock album. i would love to hate it on general principle but i cannot. i like it. it is the perfect end to karma police and the perfect lead-in to electioneering. oh yeah what is with everyone hating on electioneering? is it because it sounds most like their old stuff? more traditional? the bends is sitting at number 60 right now it is not like people do not like their old sound. apart from pablo honey not sure that really counts. electioneering is one of the best songs i have heard i would call it the standout if not for the other standouts. they are pretty much all standouts and standouts in twelve different ways. well eleven different ways and exit music for a film. still not convinced 100 on that one. fuck still cannot believe i am 5-starring this. fuck.,1

radiohead could have been a mere one-hit wonder but with the bends they prove they are good enough musicians to produce interesting music. they worked from now on with producer nigel godrich who understood well their ambitions. ok computer is a concept album about the effects of technology on social interaction and the human experience. it came just at the right time when cyberpunk was in the public conciousness and eerily anticipated the smartphone age. leader thom yorke wrote melancholic songs that paint a doomed picture of the 21th century. jonny greenwood the best musician in the band by far has the role of adding texture and interesting instrumentation to yorkes songs. airbag is a hip hop and idm influenced track which would form the basis of their next album kid a. paranoid android is the albums centerpiece in four movements like a rock sonata. the first evolves around a flamenco-like guitar riff the second is a hard rock riff the third is a slow apocalyptic movement and the finale simply reprise the hard rock part. subterranean homesick alien fantasizes about alien abduction and recalls early pink floyd. greenwood tricks with his guitars ring modulator. exit music for a film is a dramatic song influenced by romeo and juliet and features a theatralic mellotron choir by greenwood. let down is a beautiful polymetric guitar ballad with ultra depressing lyrics. karma police is a cyberpunkish distopian song influenced by beatles essentially about a world with a social credit system. ey. fitter happier satirizes self-optimizing with a computer voice. electioneering is a noam chomsky tribute hard rock number. climbing up the walls is inspired by modern classical a moody soundtrack-like trip hop song. no surprises musically is the odd one out a peaceful requiem for a suicidal man. it has a brilliant riff doubled on guitar and glockenspiel. it is the emotional center of the record. lucky is an anthemic song about a plane crash. the tourist makes a full circle with airbag it is about a car crash probably an allegory about technology as it is both the crashing car and the airbag. it is a creative record musically and thematically. it is one of the highest rated albums of all time. 910,1
en chile la juventud conoce a radiohead o como una banda para deprimidos o como los creadores del single mas triste de sus vidas creep coreado hasta el hartasgo siendo que es su cancion menos agradable por no decir que es la peor. otra parte de la juventud cree que es una gran banda de rock alternativo y experimental creadores del disco the bends 1995 y sobre todo de crear el que muchos llaman el dark side of the moon de la decada de los 90s nombre dado por los progres y algunos gerentejos que solo se afanan en coimear asi es me refiero a su gran obra ok computer de 1997. el disco abre con airbag una de las canciones mas sensacionales del disco que da la sensacion de dar vueltas en un espiral en un lapso en que sufres y te salvas de un accidente de milagro. subterranean homesick alien es otra de las grandes canciones que posee el disco junto a la melancolica desesperacion de exit music for a film. singles como paranoid android y karma police a veces aburren pero no si las escuchas junto al disco entero cosa que a veces no pasa con no surprises. climbing up the walls nos lleva a una desesperacion tetrica sobre todo con el desgarrador grito del final thom yorke si que sabe como poner su voz para cada ocasion algo imitado por personajes tales como chris martin de coldplay o matthew bellamy de muse por no decir las genialidades de los guitarristes johnny greenwood y ed obrien el bajo de colin greenwood y la bateria de phil selway un equipo que cuando se juntan pueden crear cosas increibles excepto en pablo honey su disco mas mediocre. lucky habia aparecido en el disco de caridad the help album y todo culmina con the tourist un tema algo mas calmado. otra cosa alucinante es fitter happier donde en un estilo algo parecido a un stephen hawkins nos hablan con un fondo espectral. despues el grupo demoraria cuatro aos en lanzar el buen kid a con un radical cambio en su sonido pero este disco sera recordado como el pinaculo del rock noventero y una gran influencia para ese indie rock que nos gobierna incluso el reggae no ha quedado excento de la influencia de radiohead sino escuchen radiodread de easy star all-stars. simplemente es un disco que no puedes dejar pasar en tu coleccion.,1
in the past radiohead were simply one of those bands that made me question why so many people respect them as musicians. i only heard a few songs from them. to sum it up i was completely ignorant when it came to their music. but now that i am at a point in my life where i have listened to so many different bands i gave these guys a chance by making ok computer my introduction to their music. ok computer took quite a while to grow on me. i could tell the music was good but i still did not understand why this band and this record is so highly respected. so i listened deeply again and again and i realized. the songs have such a huge impact and saying that is an understatement. the music on this record moved me in a way like no other record has and that really says a lot coming from me. listening to this record is haunting once you give it a proper listening. the thing i really love about ok computer is the vast amount of awesome song writing. i wish i could create riffs like these. jonny greenwood is now one of my top favorite guitarists. what i like about him is that his guitar playing sounds like it was influenced by pink floyd and the pixies. this is an album in which people would argue that it is derivative but even though one can easily trace the influences the end product still feels like something new and unique. not only musically but lyrically this record shines. the focal point of the lyrics seem to be on the rise of technology having a stronger hold on society but it more or less seems to generally touch upon the alienation that many go through trying to live in the western society. this is reminiscent to the themes that are covered in many punk rock records but when you combine these heavy themes with the melancholic sound of radiohead you get the same message but galvanizing in a way that feels more poignant. the way the words are delivered by thom yorke really brings out the depth of the lyrics and the music. not only that but the whole band shines as a unit. contrary to the despondent tone of the themes touched upon in the lyrics soundwise the music to me surprisingly sounds like music for a beautiful day. there are moments where the album goes into darker territory from exit music to climbing the walls but songs like let down and especially the tourist are what really drives the tone of the record. ok computer is like a long lonely walk through a beautiful sunny metropolitan area and nothing else brings me back to the 90s as much as this album.,1
ok computer... an album that garners so much respect and yet so much hate. no matter ones opinion of it ok computer is a milestone in the history of modern music. it did not completely revolutionize modern music nor did it introduce any novel style. what it did was blend a variety of influences ranging from pink floyd and david bowie to pixies and even miles davis- yorke has stated that the sounds of bitches brew fundamentally influenced the creation of this album- with creative zeal and seamless execution all packaged in an accessible yet sonically varied alternative rock sound. this mix proved to be just right for the time as it was almost immediately received as a modern classic. the popularity they had gained from pablo honey and the respect they had received from the bends secured ok computers popularity but its reputation far exceeds anything that came about from those two albums. say what you will about any of its pretensions- of which there are many- what radiohead accomplished here is no small feat this is no average alternative rock album. structurally it flows with subtle progressions utilizing many layers of sound to produce an inviting yet intricate atmosphere. while kid a and amnesiac would be electronic albums at heart this is still a rock album at the core. the electronic elements simply add flavor to the mix accentuating greenwood and obriens simple yet highly effective guitar chords and harmonies and yorkes passionate vocal delivery and lyrics. the lyrical themes themselves are sufficient for a full-length review but i will leave that study in post-modern social commentary to more accomplished critics. my only significant gripe here is that the album grows slightly tiring after no surprises as the last two tracks sound like filler more than anything else- although the tourist has its moments. in other words screw the haters. this deserves respect.,1
beautiful amazing stunning great work atmospheric... i am sorry i cannot find more words for that album... it is just full of great songs... the best way to enjoy it late at night with headphones... and if it is possible while sitting in the car or bus empty road rainy weather... that is an amazing experience. best songs of the great songs paranoid android subterrenean homesick alien karma police,1
have you ever had someone tell you that something is the greatest thing ever? maybe your friend thought inception was the best movie of all time. maybe your girlfriend says that the dq blizzard she is enjoying is the best thing ever. she is probably getting fat and you do not like that. maybe someone is saying that some album by radiohead is the best thing to happen to music ever or at least since the 60s. perhaps it is not just one person. perhaps it is a whole bunch of people. perhaps it is everyone. that is the way it is for ok computer. i am not just talking about rym either. actually rym is not even the place where this band is worshiped the most which is insane considering this album seems to bounce around the top 3 on the rym charts here. that is also quite fascinating to me as well. i have never actually really listened to radiohead but the fact that an album from 1997 is rivaled only by a couple of albums by the beatles for overall rating on this website is pretty amazing. living under my rock and listening only to my emperors my neurosises and my other metals it still is kind of hard for me to understand how an album can be so universally loved. i know a lot of people i am mostly talking about the people who listen to music thoroughly not your garden variety eminem fans who do not like some of the other top albums from around here like bob dylan pink floyd and led zeppelin. with radiohead i have 40 friends on this site who have rated ok computer and their ratings actually average out to an amazing 4.49 8th highest rated album by my rym friends and remember that i listen to almost exclusively metal. over half of those ratings are 5 star ratings too. does it live up to it is praise? well i am not expecting it to. this is not really my favourite type of music. i have listened to this band in small doses before youtubing them or just listening to a song here and there out curiosity to see if they really are all that. they would never really grabbed me all that much. sure paranoid android is pretty awesome but i did not find anything close to that in quality. then i heard airbag and that changed. my attitude towards this album quickly changed from cautious and a little bit skeptical to a sort of surprised excitement. two songs in this album is awesome. the last ten songs however do not match up in individual quality. not even close. that is okay though. this is an album that i know if i listened to any song on it is own i would not enjoy it nearly as much as i would if i was listening to the album in it is entirety. this has probably been said before and often but this is an album. it is not a collection of songs. it is meant to be listened to as a whole and it works best as a whole. the mood and the flow of this album is actually pretty incredible. to be honest i was actually less than impressed with this album my first listen. i was a little more impressed with my second listen. it seems to be how it works with people though. this is an album that grows and i would expect it to grow a little bit more on me. i do not think i could ever understand the personal connections or how much this album means to some people but i at least understand a little bit why this album is so popular.,1
writing a review for ok computer should be like shooting fish in a barrel. all you have to do is throw around words like experimental weird sparse lush depressing classic magnum opus and my personal favorite messy masterpiece. and just like that you have a cookie-cutter review which is socially acceptable to just about all of your trendy friends. what is really funny about that previous paragraph is all the terms used above are spot on. ok computer is depressing let down no surprises. ok computer is experimental paranoid android. ok computer is sparse exit music the tourist. ok computer is lush airbag subterranean homesick alien. ok computer is weird fitter happier climbing up the walls. ok computer is all those things and more thus the album has come to take on a history of its own. you would be hard pressed to find a legitimate greatest albums list that does not have this towards the top and rightfully so. it is the kind of album that makes a band and one that can often pigeon-hole. how the hell do you top this? for radiohead it was exploring their sound to a profound extreme while still being considered rock. kid a is a great result of the frustration of trying to top something that they could not. as for ok computer it is the kind of album that taken piecemeal feels as though it cannot work but somehow the track numbering is right on and the album became a symbol for the frustration of the 90s. and who could argue? this is as good as it gets.,1
a m me parece una barbaridad siquiera plantear que este es el mejor disco de la historia pero pese a todo sigue siendo un gran disco.,1
so if for whatever reason you have not heard of this record or if you are not convinced of it is greatness i urge you to listen to it. it is radioheads best record and arguably the best record of the 90s. what is left to say about it? every song not including the interlude fitter happier but nobody ever includes that one is great. the albums first six songs is up there with the best first half of any record. airbag starts pretty abruptly and it is a bit of a difficult record to take in all at once - the angular guitars of airbag leading into the shape-shifting classic paranoid android into the spacey subterranean homesick alien and then into the tense claustrophobic exit music and it does not let up from there. every song sets its own distinct mood maybe except for electioneering a more straightforward rocker even if it is a great song. buy it and you will find yourself playing it over and over again.,1
the best album ever. period. i remember borrowing this album off a friend because it had paranoid android on it. i listened to it on a walkman and at that time i was more into heavier rock but this album just grew and grew on me. it never dates just gets better with repeated listens. i have the privilege of seeing them live twice. quite simply opened my eyes to different areas of music. the album flows from start to finish. it is sheer perfection.,1
if asked before re-listening to this album yesterday what my favourite radiohead album was i would have answered the bends in a shot. now? now i remember what i would forgotten - that ok computer was and is one of the truly great works of the last 30 years. with the lone exception of fitter happier which now just seems trite and pointless each song is worthy of 5 stars on its own merit - although i agree that electioneering does not seem to fit on the album in terms of its musical structure if not lyrical content this could be down to its placement as the next song after the aforementioned fitter happier. each song is a great song of alienation loneliness state control and a jaded feel on politics - particularly impressive when you recall it was released at the height of the new labour spin movement when tony blair moved into number 10. the prophet yorke saw through the lies! highlights? they are all highlights but let us have a little love for the oft-forgotten climbing up the walls and let down as well as the more infamous paranoid android karma police no surprises and exit music. magic stuff.,1
has been the top album of rym for quite a while. not overrated in the slightest. an absolute masterpiece.,1
many times have a tried to right a review for this album but i know that nothing i can say will live up to what this masterpiece truly is. here in my opinion is the last physical classic album in an age when technology was advancing every so rapidly. this is probably and always will be one of the most fullfilling listening experiences i have ever had. why do i say this you may ask? well let me break it all down for you and tell you why i became obsessively addicted to this fine piece of era defining rock music. let me get this straight in saying that this album is extremely unique and there is nothing like it that borders on the creative experimental force of electronic effects and compelling guitar riffs. the beatles came very close to this and are probably the closest piece of music i could relate this to. let us just say it feels like a mix of pink floyds dark side of the moon and the beatles revolver. ok computer is nothing short of a monumental and could be regarded as one of the best albums of all time to music critics. kid a is also a masterpiece in its own right but i feel as if this being more rock oriented. ok computer is extremely cool but besides that the lyrics are extremely personal and relatable. here thom yorke has moved on and matured in his songwriting once again. we see thoms writing to be weak in pablo honey at times until we reach to there second release the bends. i feel as if the bends talk about relationships in a more mature manner then pablo honey. while the bends is a deeply personal record ok computer is personal but feels distant. it actually feels like thom is talking to the modern man. themes of isolation in his lyrics are more prominent then ever before. if you really listen to the bends and i mean really listen you can see this coming. the end of nice dream has effects to it near the end that will show up all of the time in ok computer. bullet proof i wish i was has effects that add and complete the song also. so let us get to the album from johnnys guitar riff in the beginning of airbag you just know that this album is going to be epic from the get go. the drumming is what really stands out in this track. it is almost like a machine and carries the song throughout with a bass line that is unpredictable. but what really grabs me about this song is song is the imagery i actually get an adrenaline rush every single time i listen to this song. i feel like i am traveling down the highway in a car going 80 miles an hour. the song is about surviving a car crash. like a sudden wake up to yourself. in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe. you feel as if you are invincible and its like a sudden realization that death could happen at any minute and i could die so i need to live life to the fullest. radioheads music is known as depressing but this song is the most uplifting song i have ever listened to. the effects at the end create such a futuristic atmosphere that it feels like the music is alive and just i do not know how to put it.....dancing this music is alive! paranoid android feels eery from the beginning. but the way this track builds and changes keeps you on your feet the entire time. it is like bohemian rhapsody only 10x better it feels extremely cold and lost as the computer voice talks to you saying i may be paranoid but i am no android. ambition makes you look pretty ugly we as humans crave ambition but thom is going against this idea an notion almost every american craves in modern society. johnnys guitar riff!......holy shit. it grabs you and pulls you in and transcends into an ultimate explosion. until it reaches a human plea. a final stand as if you feel as if you are kneeling to god. asking for one last chance to change it around. begging for mercy as if something from the heavens will reach you and touch you and take you away from the craziness of reality. beautiful stuff guys.....first time i heard it i was utterly speechless and it moved me to tears. subterranean homesick alien is about a man who is bored and tired with his normal life. he feels as if there must be something more out there. he cannot relate to the people around him and wants to get out of his town were he feels like he is stuck and his fate to die there. there all uptight uptight he cannot stand the life around him. this song reminds me of my parents. how there lives suddenly become dull and uptight about everything because they feel as if there safe if they are. worrying all the time and do not always understand what is important in life. they need to let loose. so sometimes i do feel like i just want aliens to take me away in a sense and start a new life. to see what really is out there. to go away and disappear to somewhere far away because i do not feel like a belong here creep reference. but sometimes i want to scream this song to adults who are uptight with there old age. they become worn down by modern society. exit music for a film so so haunting. its about romeo and juliet. telling her that its time to leave there families and start there own life together and never see them again. but there parents are blinded by the fact that they love each other because they have there differences and absolutely hate each other. they tell each other to calm down because they are so angry at there family for not knowing how they feel. breath...keep breathing do not lose your nerve. there families hate there love so in turn they hate there own family. they cannot breath without each other so if one dies they both die because they are one. sing us a song.....a song to keep us warm there is such a chill such a chiilll. then the creepy kid voices come in and i feel extremely cold and hopeless. i feel frozen to the spot. we hope that you choke....that you choke. wow. those lyrics are unreal and filled with so much anger and coldness. let down probably my favorite song on the album. so sad but at the same time feels so beautiful and uplifting. the piano and the off kilter time signature is beautiful. going back to the them of transportation every time i am in a carplane or train listening to this it fits the mood perfectly. as you look at the window in your car you see the highway in front of you. cars moving past your face and thinking about how some of those people might feel driving home from a long day at work.....alone. the expectations of millions of people at once feeling let down because it did not live up to what it thought it would. you simply let down again and it happens every single day. it happens over and over until you become cold hearted she will of a person. you simply are worn out by life in general. your clinging on to things that you make you happy but which in turn you are not feeling the love and emotion you once felt as a child. the computer bleeps at the end and the crascendo build up to a magnificent focal point. you know where you are with floor collapsing falling bouncing back and one day i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction. again saying that one day you are going to escape all of this but it may never happen. karma police has to deal with how we curse other people. saying that we want bad things to happen to certain people that put us down. praying that justice will soon catch up with them and in turn there is a balance in the universe. he is different so i do not like him. her hitler hairdo is making feel illhe talks in maths he is a jew therefore i cannot love him. he is black so we cannot see eye to eye and you cursed me to hell. damn you all burn in hell because i never did anything to you it is never my fault it is always yours. begging for some force to damn them. this is what you get when you mess with us. but then he realizes he is at fault for calling on the karma police to get them. therefore he in turn is just as evil as the person persecuting him. phew for a minute i lost myself. he feels as if he is losing his mind. why are bad things happening to me if i did not do anything wrong. so it buzzes in his head and never stops......hes going crazy. if he believes in karma why is it happening to him? fitter happier the ideal way a person should be. trying to as perfect as possible and comfortable and safe. as we try to perfect ourselves we become dull and fake. the media shows us false information on how we should really be if we want to live a full and happy life. but we become stuck in routines and like a computer. programmed to do what we are told by the media. we become lost because everyone else is behaving in this same manner. so we behave in the same manner as everyone else in society to fit in. but the person is like a pig in a cage no matter what he can never escape. he was programmed from birth to behave in a certain way. it is telling us this is how we should live our life. do not listen! rebel against the same be unpredictable and do not get stuck in routine because it will kill you...... electioneering politics that are not for the people. the canidate will stop for nothing. he will say the right things even though he probably will not act upon them when he is in office. i go forwards and you go backwards....and somewhere we will meet. sarcastic view on how the republican and democratic party will see eye to eye and get things done. but in reality nothing really gets down when both sides are fighting. this is the ultimate political protest song. with johnny once again showcasing his insane guitar ability. although i feel as if this could have fit on the bends better it is the only weak point on the whole album. not saying that its filler but something else like something off of airbag how am i driving ep could have fit this spot better in my opinion. i am going to sum it up here and talk about four songs to wrap it up in one paragraph because i know this is to long of a review. climbing up the walls is about someone who is depressed and cannot fight it away. it may be about thoms own depression. again a bleak outlook saying that there is no escape. that the person himself is depression and it is who they are. no suprises is one of the singles and has a beautiful tune just as let down has. but talks about a man commiting suicide by turning on his car in his garage and killing himself with carbon monoxide poisoning. the man in the album has become so cold and lifeless that he finds no point in living anymore in this material world. lucky is a sarcastic view on how things will change but probably never will. the tourist is like the exact opposite of airbag. slow moving and its almost like the world flashing before your eyes before you crash. that everyone in the world needs to slow down and look at the world around them. do people ever question what is going on around them? do we ever take the time to smell the flowers and love life before it all slips away? do not worry and the troubles in your life are only temporary live life to the fullest! troubles are not the end of you. i feel as if the story is about a man who saw life as depressing and a terrible place to be and went crazy........but never really stopped the craziness in time. tragic but we all feel like this. the computer crashed. 1010,1
i was merely a six year old urchin when this album came out. my dad purchased it on cassette and used to play it constantly from 6pm until about 9pm. i would randomly eat cereal late at night in the dining room whilst fitter happier more productive would come on and make me think i was going to die early by eating sugary cereal that i would eventually burst to tears. if you buy this album do not let your children eat cereal near it. you wanted a real review? well like everyone else has already said they already said that everything has already been said...ever!! so take my advice and if you buy the album just keep what i said in mind whilst listening to thom yorke do his falsetto thingy as jonny greenwood goes on airbag duh-ruuuun-dunnnn-daaaaah-dooooo-doooo etc.,1
there is not anything i can say about this album that will not sound like utter hyperbole. i have been madly and hopelessly in love with it for the past 13 years. in that time i have easily listened to each song will over 1000 times each and not one of them have gotten old yet. if you do not love this album you obviously have not really listened to it. if i were to make one criticism this album would have been 100 perfect if the tourist was in between karma police  electioneering and fitter happier was the intro. also as much as i love the beatles how exactly does anything on abbey road or revolver match the beauty contained in this album? i just do not see it...,1
it should be number 1  but people like these 2 assholes below tend to rate low just because they do not think okc should be at number 3  instead of rating the music . this is fuckin 5 stars music  like it or not .,1
it reads february 28 2007 or should i say it actually reads like this an instant immortal classic. 1997 album was radioheads 3rd and clearly the best. this is really the best album of a band that clearly makes the best music. lovers of the bends might be contrary to my opinion but apart from that album ok computer contributed more to the music world. clearly this album most be in a better place than number 9 oh that was me. this month this will become three years old this dates back to my first entry ever written for this page like if i needed something else to make this a special album for me now it is also a milestone of how things have changed. rym has changed its appearance has added lots of new features and has been growing in number of members and their interactions with the site and oh yeah ok computer was at 9. me? i was 15 years old back then easy to be impressed and quite a bad reviewer. i believe i have improved nowadays though i am still sore for not having a front page review. anyways ok computer is still one of my favorite records though nowadays i have reconciled myself with lovers of the bends and i am actually one of them now. although my emotions overcame me on that review i acknowledge the album itself had a lot to do. the music is intriguing not really letting you know what it is about though you somehow get to comprehend it filled with emotionally charged songs and great songwriting this is really a modern classic and even if many people around think it is lame to like radiohead get over these guys have already proven their worth.,1
yorke and greenwood grow into musical adults and earn themselves a label of best british band for the nineties riding along with the happy hell that comes with greatest album of all time and the beatles and floyd fans who scream in purple-faced indignation waving their preferred classic albums like revolutionaries. paranoid electro-rock which is not quite electro-rock at all. it is awesome and full of deus ex machina moments so unaware of themselves that one wants to laugh hysterically,1
what a stunner. it creates a whole new dimension that had never been heard before in music upon its 1997 release it is very complex there is something new and nice to hear each listen and i continue to be amazed by the rich sound landscape still after all my listens. it is not the best album to listen to if i am in a happy mood i got to be at least somewhat down or else i will turn it off after a song but on headphones speakers whatever and the perfect melancholic mood it always sounds great. every song is a masterpiece in that state of mind with the possible exception of fitter happier but that one is designed to help the album along its theme and the reason is radiohead had gained the ability to see their ability with the bends and this was the next natural step. while i do not consider it to be the best album ever radiohead hit every single note right with ok computer this is what transformed 5 boys from abingdon oxfordshire into men that could compose at a 1000 feetsecond.,1
in my humble opinion this is the best album ever recorded no not just by radiohead but by any band in the history of music. there is no question about it. when i listen to this album it completely transforms me. it is the only album i have ever listened to that makes me absolutely float in air. it is almost a religious experience to listen to this album. every song on the album is unbelievably good. however i will rank my top 5 below in order 1. let down 2. exit music 3. karma police 4. paranoid android 5. airbag,1
i hate it when people give this album like 12 a star and say that its so over rated and thom yorke has an annoying voice! then they go ona rant about how its so overplayed and the corporations are all corporationy! and some say that if you listen to it without the hype than its not actually very good! bull shit! its an incredible album and maybe its not the best album ever! but its worth 5 stars. maybe 3 12 stars if you did not really get it. i get pissed off when people try to be different by giving an incredible album a terrible review. you cannot say this is the worst album ever and it deserves less than half a star unless you are looking for attention. because no matter how you look at it this is at least a good album in my opinion its a fantastic album but its not a crap album anybody who uses the word overrated deserves to burn in hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
radiohead finally truly find there sound. amazing but not quite the perfection of there next record nor is it the greatest record of all time. but it is nice to see this album at 1 instead of some shitty beatles record.,1
so it is finally come to this...the album proclaimed by so many overprivileged white teens and 20-something is to be the greatest recording ever created by man. i remember when i was in high school i worked with a guy at a supermarket yes obviously it was whole foods that told me he wanted to destroy his stereo and shatter his eardrums after listening to ok computer because nothing else he would ever hear in his life could possibly compare to what he had just experienced. needless to say i was skeptical and growing up in white suburbia...this album was the favorite of the majority of my classmates and i tried my hardest to resist it is evil pull. by the time college came around i cautiously gave this dangerous album a listen and was completely underwhelmed. the hype built around this behemoth was immeasurable and the product while certainly well written and decently executed simply did not resonate with me the way it had with so many of my peers. ok computer has a lot of great tracks airbag paranoid android exit music for a film karma police etc. and to be fair none of the songs are bad at least objectively but i have wrestled for years on what separates this album from some of my favorite albums. i recently came up with a few reasons why i do not consider this to be one of the greatest albums of all time or even the decade 1 radiohead is too subtle with much of their overdubbinglayering...now the vocal layerings for the most part are flawless but the guitar overdubs are often downplayed and too subtle to even follow i often do not even notice that they are there. i understand that this is part of the mystique and atmosphere of the album but come on...quite pretentious. 2 i think thom yorke had a root canal during fitter happier because he seems incapable of enunciating words on the second half of the album...i mean the band might as well have had the lead singer of sigur rs for tracks 8-12...because i have no idea what he is singing half the time. 3 the track the tourist just ends...so many of the tracks have very downplayed and subtle build-ups and then stop abruptly the final track is no exception and stands out more because it is the last track. 4 after a discussion with my buddy chuck rym user aborodin i realized that one of the biggest problems with the album is that there is no real moment of catharsis. radiohead teases you with big build-ups and flashes of emotional expulsions on paranoid android and karma police specifically but there is no moment on this album where i get a shiver down my spine and feel complete...some examples of what i mean are as follows -the guitar break-out at the end of only in dreams on weezer blue album. -the string build-up at the end of still life on dog man star. -the climactic ode to joy chorus from beethovens 9th symphony. -the guitar solo on stairway to heaven from led zeppelin iv. -quite possibly my favorite musical movement of all time the final verse as sure as eggs is eggs of suppers ready from foxtrot and the subsequent guitar fill by steve hackett cannot you feel our souls ignite shedding ever changing colours in the darkness of the fading night like the river joins the ocean as the germ in a seed grows we have finally been freed to get back home. there is an angel standing in the sun and he is crying with a loud voice this is the supper of the mighty one the lord of lords king of kings has returned to lead his children home to take them to the new jerusalem. now that is catharsis and in the end that is really what ok computer lacks...nb- not every album requires such a musical feat but for title of greatest album of all-time you certainly do. for all it does right this is a great collection of songs and ironically for all of it is overproduction it just feels incomplete...but hey at least it is better than kid a. a really good album and a must-listen...just not the best of the decade. great! -mmm,1
this is the best album that has ever been made. i will not listen to any dissenting opinions if you disagree you should see a psychiatrist. this plays like the best concert you could think of starting with the power chord at the beginning of airbag to the final triangle ding of the tourist. there are no songs on here that are skip worthy the closest being fitter happier. it is an album that can not be surpassed for at least another 25 years. the best gift you can give anyone in music.,1
ok computer is a great album and more than enough has been written to justify why that is so. whether you want to call it the album of the 90s or album of the century people who love this album can agree that it is prophetic in its vision and it is completely unique sounding even for the time. it certainly withstands the test of time. however it is also very misunderstood. when i first listened to this as a high-schooler i hated every second of it and i did not even complete the album. this was also true of the 2nd 3rd and 4th times i listened to it. i hated thoms stupid high-pitched nasally voice i hated how his name was thom spelt like that i hated the depressing nature of the lyrics. all i wanted was some music with some ooomph and ok computer was not cutting it. looking back it is strange how i did not like it because this album is equally as angsty as i was at the time. i eventually came to realize that there are a lot of powerful ooomph-y songs on here but they do not deliver oomph the same way as some of radioheads radio cohorts do a failing of modern rock radio if you ask me. i kept giving it periodic tries trying to believe the hype. then one day when i was in my early 20s it finally clicked. i liked the whole thing front to back and totally got it. it was full of sound and soul of helplessness and desperation of buildups and crashes of torture and serenity. what changed? the world changed. broadband internet and streaming video was the norm smartphones became ubiquitous social media made us all feel simultaneously connected and isolated. i certainly was older but age is not what helped me like the album listening to ok computer is not like reading siddhartha. broad musical exposure definitely helped but that was not it either. weed definitely helped but that was not it. it also was not coming to the realization of how much it reminds me of the wall. i was 7 when this album came out...why did i appreciate it now? what ultimately did it was this realization we live in an increasingly anxious and isolated s o c i e t y! now go angsty teen who thinks thom yorkes voice makes him sound like a whiny bitch go listen to ok computer with headphones on. you will realize that he is a whiny bitch just like we all are. you will get tingles on your skin when thom screams at the top of his lungs at the end of climbing up the walls. you will cry after the bridge of let down. you will appreciate the slow build-up of exit music for a film and your jaw will drop when you figure out it was for some shitty leo dicaprio romeo  juliet movie. you will think it is powerful and poignant and entirely appropriate for our times. you will fucking get it...eventually.,1
hey this album needs another review right? well no...not really but none of these hundreds of reviews and thousands of ratings really mean anything at all anymore so why do not i fling some monkey-poo at the wall anyway. upon it is release i bought it - i liked the first two albums felt there was a progression happening something intelligent going on. i was deeply impressed for awhile by it is sheer proggy-ness it is attempted reach into some spooked out atmosphere referencing some of lennons darker white album material and sprinkling a post-pixies dust over top of it. but that was 1997 and it did not take long for every pseudo-hipster to tag this album as some kind of important landmark in music and this was one of those times that kind of bandwagon jumping left a nasty singe in my brain. radiohead were actually forced into commercial suicide from the wake of this albums reputation. but - whatever....my own personal end-result of this whole scene the album created was to pretty much shelve it for the next decade. whenever i did pull it out the only track i would really ever play was fitter happier - which probably says something about me that i am not particularly proud of. last night i pulled this off the shelf and played it from start to finish with a large whiskey sour and my rapt attention. listening to this cycle of songs that are filled with fear and dread i started to feel uncomfortable. doomed even. there is no comfort in this album it is the continuous sound of things falling apart the world falling out from under your feet. it is not pleasant. but it is so achingly beautiful in places i cannot deny that. yorkes vocals feel like depression incarnate like an ill animal trapped in a room festering with cockroaches. the music and it is production try to piggy-back onto this vibe and mostly succeeds. but then there is that last track which does not fall into the mood of the other eleven it is making a somewhat vain attempt to end on some kind of twisted hopeful air. it fails completely but has some brilliant harmonic structures and phrases. the whole of the listen left me with a feeling of unlucky prophecy. and really that is uncool. this will have to stay back on the shelf until i hit some moment in life where it is appropriate to listen again. on a side note the only other album that gives me this vibe is pink floyds animals - which like this stays on the shelf mostly despite a healthy respect for it is content and is something i can only listen to when it is the right emotional moment.,1
this album is an arty album. it must hence be said that as such you must have the patience to fall in love with it or hate it but you must give yourself the time to make up your own opinion and do not let yourself be influenced by the high position it gets from this website although i personally believe that you could be a lot worse off. this album is great. its sound is so ahead of any time that it represents a futuristic world that it does not like and that explains the title or perhaps could be taken as a representation. the songs are often invaded by digital and technoligic sounds that blow us away and initially even annoy us but we go on to love them as they progress in the song. an example of this is found in let down with the synth that sonds like old video game sounds harpeggios so surreal yet so fitting in the overwhelming sound that can be found throughout the album indeed from the first track to the last. it is perhaps the way the sound is so full and so overwhelming that on first listen we are fascinated by it but on second listen we feel completely oblivious and begin to strangly support the thesis that this album is overrated. it is possible to think so during and after the second listen but it is important when exposed to this album to give it another shot because it is only after the thrid listen that we appreciate this album as a music album. the paradox is that the album lives thinks and breathes to be a non-music album the anti-pop-rock album almost stripped of any sing along choruses or hum along riffs. whenever you expect radiohead to play one chord they play an unlikely one instead and leave the pop version of their music to muse the poppy version of radiohead. on a musical point of view this is very admirable and avant garde something that probably has not even been fully appreciated yet but is surely starting to be aknowledged. this is not an album to please the crown this is an album to find one and haunt it forever. the meanings of the lyrics have something that sounds like a paranoid futuristic or if you will subterranean homesic version of morrissey diluting haunting one liners like the iconic and representative kicking squealing gucci little piggy in paranoid android or for a minute there i lost myself that are lines that do not follow a narrative pattern but are deeply rooted in the unsafety of the human mind and species and has been so since the beginning of time. the most chart friendly track and the one to be loved from the beginning is karma police but not for that reason is it the best album. then there is no surprpises. everything else needs to be appreciated.,1
1st listen very enjoyable 2nd listen ehh not much lasting power 3rd listen what the hell was i talking about? 4th listen this is a masterpiece thom yorke is at his absolute best vocally sounding like an angel or a great beinggod at times. his voice can be so chilling soothing but at the same time frantic and worried. this is perhaps shown best by my favorite song on the album exit music for a film at one point this is a beautiful love song about escaping and at the same time is a frantic plead for somebody to help thom run away. the song is so basic but once the climax hits......i cannot describe it at all. so filling so emotional so loving god it is beautiful. especially once he starts yelling we are one in everlasting peace amazing line. what is truly so amazing about this album is that my favorite song on the album constantly changes. one month i am like man airbag is a classic the next month i will be saying yea sure its a classic but lucky is even better. kind of hard to describe what i mean by that but i love it because i look forward to every song on this album. climbing up the walls and fitter happier are usually at the root of complaints for most people well actually most people do not have any complaints about this album but thing is they fit in so well with the album it works no matter if its a favorite or not. plus they really show off their more experimental side on those songs and i am really glad they did because it adds even more variety to this already flawless album. so pretty much its obvious by now that this is one of the greatest albums i have ever heard. from the beginning unforgettable riff of airbag to the last little innocent perfect bell chime at the end of the tourist there is nothing wrong. this album literally saved me musically two years ago when a substitute teacher recommended it to me. best. teacher. ever. it really was the first album in any genre that i truly cared about and that made me think. really if it was not for this masterpiece i would still be listening to mainstream rap. thank you thom. thank you airbag paranoid android exit music for a film let down the tourist edit this deserves 2 overall it really does,1
i have tried to explain why i think this is a perfect album but every time i do i end up waffling and let us face it you have probably heard it all before. with that in mind... ladies and gentlemen i bring you... the top ten moments on ok computer! 10 the tourist - 515 what better place to start than the last sound heard on the album? it is that humble ping. 9 no surprises - the intro glockenspiel-y loveliness. 8 subterranean homesick alien - 259 things all get a bit much for thom but he chills and resolves that he will be alright. 7 paranoid android - 535 ...god loves his children yeah! cue jonnys freak-out. really though you could make a top ten moments in paranoid android list. 6 karma police - 315 ed obrien is responsible for this cool noise apparently who would have thought? totally makes that awesome final section. 5 lucky - 111 is this jonnys most spine-tingling guitar line to date? i think it may just be. 4 airbag - the intro that guitar-come-cello makes me want to swoon but that drum loop urges me to dance. quite unlike anything else on the album. 3 climbing up the walls - 357 where yorkes demonic wail and the sinister rising strings create a dissonant harmony all of their own. 2 exit music for a film - 248 selways bass drum makes its grand entrance and is swiftly joined by the fuzziest of bass guitars. what follows is one of the most intense crescendos i have ever heard. 1 let down - 341 few moments make the hair on my neck stand on edge like this one does. an astounding climax containing hope by the bucket-load. best song on the album for what it is worth.,1
read with caution note the date despite the drastic change in my listening habits during the past couple of years i do not think i will ever come to genuinely dislike this album the nostalgia is just too strong. if i have listened to an album in unusually excessive amounts i tend to associate that album with phases of mine such as the phase when i was obsessed with a certain deceased online game called wormhole. familiar music carries strong visual and memorial connections and can eventually come to symbolize something i heavily associate with it. this album ok computer carries the most memories and symbolizes the most things of any album i have ever listened to. just hearing thoms voice lilt on exit music immediately summons up the darker heartwrenching scenes of fire emblem fe7 in japan the tourist recalls the daily trips to and from dads office building back in michigan. i do not use quotation marks because these songs are so familiar and so vital to the memories of my early adolescence and quote marks have a certain alienating oh the irony effect to them. i will never forget the first time i heard the album i was around 12 i think and my sister was driving me around with her on errands. wanting to infect me a veritable pre-teen pleb who thought all star was the greatest song ever with some more sophisticated music she had recently discovered a feat which she was ultimately more successful at i think than even she knows she played this for me. i regarded it amicably and with curiosity i rather liked the first two songs loved the third one especially for its cosmic guitar tone did not know what to think of the dark fourth one and generally liked the rest of the songs i heard marveling of course at that weird seventh one. she said the band which had recently replaced the atarees as her favorite band was called radiohead. that fact stayed in the back of my mind for the next couple of weeks. after that time that fact came out of hibernation and my curiosity sparked. i listened to the album again and it was pretty much instant love. the swooping guitars of airbag the general epicness of paranoid android the jagged terror of climbing up the walls the singular album-closer feel of the tourist i bathed in the rapture and loved every second of it. authentic aural ecstasy ensued in this manner for many months to come i committed lyrics to rote memory i hummed riffs and melodies during meals and i constantly revised my opinions of the best tracks. nearly every track got a turn at best song even fitter happier. it was the most anyone could ever expect from music. while i got into some other alternative stuff like the flaming lips and belle  sebastian ok computer remained my one true love. of course though all good things come to an end. i eventually set the album aside in favor of some fresher tunes which i had not worn down to the bone and i explored the rest of radioheads material. then i moved from michigan back to new york an introspective and reserved kind of guy i did not make any real friends during the semester before the summer. during that summer i rejoined a radiohead forum i had previously only casually browsed my interest in music piqued i started downloading everything in sight and here i am now. if i listened to this album for the first time today i would probably think it a pretty good album but quite undeserving of the heaps of praise and pure hatred thrown upon it. ok computer occupies a singular place in the canon these days it is probably the gateway album the one-man transition from classic hard rock to indie and alternative music and culture in general. ok computer is coming to be an essential white adolescent experience of vaunted proportions if you have not heard this record whether you love it or despise it you do not know anything about indie culture. my once pure view of this unique album is now tainted by the context of a broader knowledge of music and societal trends and while i always enjoy listening to it now it is simply that record the one that measures musical navet. i truly wish this were not the case but knowledge corrupts. i still retain memories of those innocent times though and visual and mental cues of that phase pop up all the time. my experiences with ok computer embody those of the complete journey from musical ignorance to avant-garde elitism comically enough i completely skipped over the comptemptible classic rock phase that so many youths go through and too many never leave. thanks meghan. it was the first album i really connected with and it still occupies a unique place in my collection. my love for the album though now not nearly my favorite is in a sense overflowing. i could never ask more from any piece of music.,1
i do not think the world would ever be the same without ok computer. it is been 10 years and a couple months change since parlophone printed it and it is still the quintessential album of our times. that is more than a title to bestow upon some preposterously well liked form of entertainment it is an anomaly. the bends signaled a bright future but not one that featured ok computer or any album as equally immense. quite frankly the album should not exist. the record is just too epic. it is almost as if the course of history was changed when ok computer dropped. just about every album ever released suits the times they are created in this record was so perfect the times suited ok computer. i know i am getting all myth maker on your ass but what else can i say? this is it. the record to end all records in the 20th century and begin all of the records in the 21st century. or something like that. to some people it was just a couple guys updating pink floyd for the grunge generation. i prefer to call those people dumbasses. okay pink floyd is indeed a distant relative i will give those dumbasses that but they are still no where near as immediate. the bends comes closest and that is not even in the same universe. there really is nothing like it prior to or since. again an anomaly. no other music album i have heard represents so many feelings at the same time fear hope despair destruction alienation open air claustrophobia triumph quietude failure anxiety trepidation uneasiness contentment nonchalance harmony peace distortion...nothing can even capture 116th of its majesty. ok computer is so isolated from everything else because it was made under isolation. jonny greenwood said it best the main difference in the atmosphere from past albums was in... the studio experience. we were all of the same age mid- to late-twenties and doing a record in the middle of nowhere. and there were no established professionals there. it was not a real recording studio and we had our friend stanley donwood doing the artwork in the studio at the same time. we were all at the same stage of our life and all working together for something it was quite a buzz. recording an album by yourself is not a new concept but in the right hands it can create something entirely uncontaminated and virgin...which is pretty much what happened with ok computer. in case you were just born you may be asking yourself what this record sounds like. imagine if the happiest day of your life was the day you killed yourself. it is like opening christmas presents during the apocalypse. a spaceflight directly into the sun. getting the best sleep of your life on top of the button that simultaneously launches all the nukes in the world. driving your car into a pit of fire. ok computer marries thrill and harrow joy and death ordinary and impossible all that and more. to say the album is nothing short of magic would be hitting the nail on the head. now you do not have to love this album. you do not have to even like it. all preceding hyperbole is just how i see it. hell it is not even my favorite radiohead album. the thing is i believe that at some point in your life you will love ok computer. your deathbed 7th grade a walk in the park working at the same desk after 32 years watching your two dogs fuck doing your sons math homework your sisters wedding reception whatever the situation sooner or later this album will get you. it is just too powerful to be ignored. i mean this is it. thom yorke would never write better lyrics than he did here. radiohead would never sound more natural than they did here. the pressure upon radiohead would never be as assuring as it was frightening as it is here. critical consensus on a radiohead record would never be as definite as it is here. history probably could not be encapsulated on a record better than it is here. be all end all. this whole review is nothing new. what is there left to say anymore really? it is almost as if ok computer just left everyone imaginatively speechless. it is been about 123 months since the world changed and the only constant is just how great this record is. such a thing should not be possible... but if ok computer is possible... what is not?,1
jiminy crickets. this album is awesome. back in 97 amongst my circle of friends i was first to like this album. nobody else got it. now of course it is a huge modern classic critically acclaimed whosawitz and they all really enjoy it. i get no credit for being the first. i guess that is just how it goes. it is all perfect. thoms vocals are awesome every song is catchy and complex and owning this gives you cred. that is three things going for it! how many did sgt. peppers have going for it again? two? oh yeah that is right. no i am not going to explain this thought any further i like every song on here but i thought i would shout out to some esoteric favorites that most of the other reviewers tend to gloss over. fitter happier to me is a lot more than just filler. it is creepy and interesting with the most gripping lyrics on the album. that line still kisses with saliva always gets me for some reason. packs a lot of punch. i also really like climbing up the walls. that is some mad crescendo it is got in the chorus there! sends chills down your spine. and uh none of the other tracks are esoteric favorites at all but i will say that no surprises is one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard. possibly overhyped but it is still one of the greatest albums of the 90s.,1
o radiohead ou  amado ou odiado. muitos o consideram a salavao da msica inglesa dos anos 90 muitos os consideram uma banda chata e pretensiosa. o que eu acho? acho que  uma banda fantstica. do comeo melanclico e triste do primeiro disco a este grande disco a banda sempre continuou inquieta e cheios de idias uma grande banda que merece sempre ser ouvida.  bom que faam um som assim them plenos 9000. 01. airbag o clima  claustrofbico. alis isso  sinnimo de radiohead mas ao mesmo tempo a melodia te pega pelo calcanhar e faz com que voc fique de ouvidos atentos. uma programao encobre de certa forma a bateria de phil selway e a linha de baixo simples e perfeita de colin greenwood mandam na msica se bem que as duas guitarra da banda ed obrien e johnny greenwood constroem sempre linhas desconcertantes. sem contar as linhas meldicas de thom yorke que tem um dos vocais mais legais de toda a dcada de 90  a emoo na ponta da lngua. 02. paranoid android caraca se essa no  a msica mais claustrofbica insana e que aperta o peito j escrita no  nada do comeo ao fim a sensao  quase indescrtivel uma linha de violo estranhssima vocais quebras por todos os lados. as guitarras sempre muito afiadas e cheia de dor. antes da doidera maior e peso uma linha de baixo muito boa excelente! ento eis que surge um belo de um coral bizantino risos falando pelo fato de remeter a igreja mas no tenho certeza se  mesmo. 03. subterranean homesick alien de uma sutileza absurda! o nome me remeteu diretamente a subterraneam homesick blues do bob dylan mas o que ouvimos aqui  uma melodia de tirar o flego. daquelas que difcilmente a gente esquece to cedo. memorvel! 04. exit music for a film melancolia? no! isso  mais que melanclico! se voc tiver tendncias suicidas passe longe risos  daquelas que se voc no toma cuidado te lava pra baixo tambm. somente voz e violo e um teclados pra l de macabro. 05. let down estranha combinao! depois de uma faixa pra l de down o que se ouve them let down o nome encaixa  uma cano quase-alegre como seria uma cano quase alegre? bem! uma cano quase alegre  aquela que quase te deicxa alegre you! que pergunta! deixando as gracinhas de lado o que temos por aqui so guitarras them linhas que estranhamente combinam entre si e uma base bem construda. e  sempre muito bom ouvir as linhas de baixo de colin muito bem construdas na msica da banda. final esperto cheio de baruhos e melodia. 06. karma police isso aqui  o mximo them angstia them formato musical comeando com o piano inicial passando pelos vocais de thom que sempre emanam algum tipo de sofrimento verdadeiro de quem sente realmente o que est cantando no so s palavras numa melodia. pela primeira vez um teclado aparece de verdade e no faz feio constri uma melodia divina. them clima apocalptico terminamos. 07. fitter happier isso aqui  o cmulo do experimentalismo. voc j viu aqueles programas de computador pra pessoas cegas que cada coisa que voc escreve  repetida por uma voz robtica? ento  disso que se trata. ao fundo somente noise experience. oua e duvide. 08. electionnering rock and roll noise! esse  o comeo uma melodia mais comum o que no  muito comum no disco. que vocalizaes fodas ao fundo da msica. guitarras por toda a parte. 09. climbing up the walls o sentindo de subir as paredes aqui  colocado de forma mais que abstrata. com percusso quase eletrnica e vocal mal tratado. s do meio pra frente que a msica se torna mais humana mas como a tnica do disco  a computadorizao isso  um luxo. risos 10. no suprises meu deus que coisa linda! do comeo da guitarrinha imitando uma caixinha de msica a melodia cheia de lirismo e lembranas.  um desafio escuitar sem se comover profundamente os vocais de yorke so emotivos at no poder mais. sensacional faz bem aos sentidos. 11. lucky baixo a frente grave guitarra acompanhando com dedilhados sensveis. e no  que os caras so bons de refro? sempre refres marcantes com melodias pra l de boas. uma coisa rara nas bandas que so mais experimentais. tem at uns lances meio jazz quase no final. 12. the tourist muitos podem achar montona concordo que tem momentos certos para ouvir o som dos caras no  pra todo mundo isso eu posso afirmar.,1
ok computer is an album of immense grandeur. now that i have lost half my audience with an unbearably pretentious statement let me explain it to the half that stayed to hear me out. ok computer is almost too awesome for it is own good. trying to comprehend all of it in one listen is like trying to read the bible in a day. it is a many layered masterpeice that continues to impress and enlighten me with every new listen. it never let us up throughout the 53 and a half minutes. as i listen to this album for what must be the 50th time in my short life i am still learning new things. furthermore i believe if i listened to it another 50 times i would still have more to learn. i know it is been said innumerable times by many people but this is an essential component of anyones collection. and i say that without any trace of hyperbole. you must own ok computer.,1
straight rock fans hate this. this is rock for folks who do not love rock. rock with brains - more than three chords. with sad and pessimistic lyrics which i never pay attention to. with uplifting effects. with abundant space to evoke visions. with luxurious details and amazing sonic spheres - from a mere quartet. almost without electronics. almost without speed. without predictability. introvert. difficult. relevant. ear-opening. monstrous. smashing! the rock album from the nineties. to be played loud.,1
without a doubt high on the list of albums that any serious music-lover needs in their collection. almost from start to finish it is filled with beautiful emotional songs with gorgeous arrangements. the production is spot on that is you do not even notice it - you just hear the song. opener airbag is just one of the most perfect first tracks you could hope to hear. it is not the best on the album but why would you want that? surely a greater pleasure is to hear something damn good then hear something infinitely better afterwards? the mixing of the tracks on ok computer is sublime. it holds together beautifully as an album and takes you on a journey filled with enigma. airbag itself is but the first song on the journey. it is a song about a car crash which the singer survives and is basically beautiful in a harsh way. the albums undoubted highlight is paranoid android. it is a bohemian rhapsody for the nineties with four parts each seguing into the other perfectly. the acoustic part one sets a tired soul against the bustle of the world. please could you stop the noise i am trying to get some restfrom all the unborn chicken voices in my head. part two introduces the best riff on the decade yes better than teen spirit.... it is menacing and thrilling and after one listen creates an incredible surge of anticipation to hear it played loud and with of briens jerky spastic touch after the line you do not remember you do not remember. listened to loud especially with headphones i have to say this is possibly the greatest moment of music of the decade. britpop? pah. thom yorke deserves far more credit as a singer than he gets. listen to his delivery of off with his head man. ohhhh. part three is subdued almost operatic. rain down raaaiiin down from a great height is the lyric to which yorke applies his strained nasal tones. the lyrical punch to the song is delivered in the least abstract of the verses in that is it sir you are leavingthe crackle of pigskinthe dust and the screamingthe yuppies networkingthe panic the vomitthe panic the vomitgod loves his childrengod loves his children yeahhh. and then here comes that riff again. the musicianship of the band is underrated rarely has a group of musicians played music together and produced so incredible an effect and certainly not since. the guitar solos at this final juncture of the song soundtrack perhaps the apocalypse. the album is honestly worth buying just for this single song alone. listen to it loud with headphones or whilst driving at night and prepare to encounter a musical dimension you have hitherto left undiscovered. imagine pink floyd but a hell of a lot more aggressive and moving. naturally after the hysteria of paranoid android subterranean homesick alien is in all honesty a dissapointment. it takes a few moments to realise that this too is a great song one about abduction. spacey noises and another fine vocal performance lend this an other-worldly feel. exit music is far too sad to listen to in a sane state of mind. nevertheless i and we do and it just makes us sad. no one has the art of a sad song down to the nack of thom yorke and co. the distorted bass towards the end takes it over the top of depression and the song lurches head-first into megalomaniac insanity. let down is one of the best songs on the album and that is really saying something. it is gentler and less directly-affecting than the other songs and features a melancholy trot of a beat and again some gorgeous vocals. the lyrics are about city life perhaps the bustle of a metropolis the unnaturalness that took some spelling after a good few lagers of mans mechanical dominion. this theme pervades through the album - or at least the mechanical unnatural aspect of human civilisation and it is depressing grayness. like i say i am wui writing under the influence fool. perhaps the best state to be in when typing about such an amazing record.. i am probably miles off. luckily radiohead lyrics are open to interpretation for the most part. karma police is great but overplayed - at least by buskers in my local city. if you have never heard it enjoy the magic for the first time! then enjoy one of the albums two lowpoints! yay! fitter happier is alright i guess but a two minute song of stephen hawking vocals listing off various middle-class life occupations like trainspotting... did anyone else find ewan macgregors narration of stuff like wide-screen televisions etc. a bit of a deflation after the glory of low-life depravation? is not going to cut it on an album of otherwise genius quality. luckily things are brought back to life with electioneering. the fury of paranoid android is resurrected sadly though without the zap. it is still a good track though and gives thom a chance to vent his anger at plastic two-faced politicians. climbing up the walls is creepy in song form. let me say no more than that. no surprises gets a little boring but the first-time charm of the glockenspiel never gets tooold. the lyrics are nice too. now. had lucky been the finale of ok computer it might have been the greatest album ever made. it is beautiful and epic. and after thom sings we are standing on the edge you assume that is it record over. and god! what a record. but unless you have been watching the tracklisting on the back of the cd case or following the lyrics booklet it is a terrible surprise and shame to have to listen to the tourist after the perfect end to the perfect radiohead album. it is not a terrible song it is just terribly placed. it is the second disappointment on ok computer and without it the album would have been a more incredible listen. it just does not end so dramatically with this tagged on the end like a lost child. as such the album gets four and a half stars. out of five. it could have been so much better radiohead. but you are for now limited to the title of one of the damndest bestest most emotionally draining incredible beautiful listenable powerful era-defining records ever recorded in the history of recording. think what could have been.,1
dear ok computer it is been a while has not it? yes too long old friend. i feel as though i owe you an apology i have not been good to you these last couple of years. remember the good old days? heh yeah you were my favourite album back then. you were my the queen is dead my nevermind. it was you i thought of as i lolloped home from school after a day of speaking as little as possible so that nobody could hear my squeaking breaking voice. no girls no alcohol just you. what happened old friend? oh of course i remember i found loveless. well i suppose i would better admit that i am still with her. i would not patronise you by saying it is not you it is me if i could help it but that is the truth - it was just time to move on. i know what you think of her she is vacuous distant pretentious. heh but do not you remember when people thought that about you? come on how many sections are there in paranoid android? hmm? too many for a lot of people. except now they have initiated you into the rock canon have not they? yeah they say you are up there with the best of them. i think we both know you are not that kind of record really not deep down you are no classic rock album. oh sure they made you while listening to led zep and the beatles but you are one of us really. you know you are. you are too passionate - i still think let down is one of the most beautiful songs ever i really do and exit music... well i do not need to tell you that it is the saddest piece of music i have ever heard. and then there is climbing up the walls of course which really is as terrifying as it was intended to be. i thought you were perfect yknow. i really did. heh i even thought karma police was your best song. can you believe that? of course you can you were there patting me on the head and saying yes of course it is dear. but you know even though i have got more perspective now even though i can see you in a more objective light... well... i guess what i am trying to say is that i never stopped loving you. i know i have grown a lot since i was with you - i listen to all kinds of things i never thought i would like everything from hardcore to ambient music. but i owe it to you really you put me on the right path you gave me the road map you sat me down and said now listen son there is a lot of music out there and you have to remember that you cannot apply rules to what is good and what is bad. remember this boy it is important you have to go with your gut. i think it is a testament to you that i am the listener i am today. so thank you ok computer. thanks for everything. yours with love and gratitude ignorantium,1
it is said that this is an album that repays repeated listening. it is also frequently said that it is the greatest-album-anywhere-in-the-universe-for-all-eternity. the first is certainly true  i can attest to that personally having listened to it all day yesterday and this morning for the sake of doing this review. i am however not yet convinced as to the latter. there are distractions. enunciate god damn it! why oh why does thom yorke have to be an effing falsetto? stop with the goosebumps already! and the last is the point really. radiohead create something unique with ok computer a sort of passionate alienation that goes to the core of the soul. impatience with some aspects of the whole  such as the expression of sentiments and fears that one does not share or the odd indulgent riff  give way to a flood of genuine emotion on listening to the album as a whole. consideration of individual tracks is a mistake although the album does not get top marks as even within the whole and despite admiring the lyrics i cannot bring myself to like the raucousness of electioneering. but otherwise an exceptional piece of work.,1
this album is definitely over-analyzed so it would be reasonable not to write too much about it. although i prefer the evolution in their two latest albums it is beyond dispute songs like paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls no surprises... are incredible art work. however i personally believe the strongest point of this album is exit music for a film. i did not really see all the beauty feel all the happiness and optimism of this song until i saw the band play it live at belfort festival. just look at thom at the end of the song the moment he sings and you can laugh a spineless laugh we hope your rules and wisdom choke you and now we are one in everlasting peace... you can feel all those feelings breaking out burning in thoms voice and manifesting on his face. this is just enough to make me fall in love with it.,1
ok computer is the album. is simply perfect an incredible mood that put you floating in space a lot of gorgeous moments and outstanding songs like paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police climbing up the walls no surprises and lucky. hard to find another better... perhaps radioheads the bends!,1
holy shit! if you do not own it buy it. it is absolutely brilliant. my favorite album ever! this cd is best listened to at midnight wheadphones and the volume cranked way up.,1
o.k. computer delves into the deepest darkest moods imaginable. it creates an atmosphere of shadows paranoia melancholy and remarkable joy. somehow simultaneously dark and uplifting. a majestic panoramic and overwhelming powerful landscape of intricately textured layered instrumentation surrounds the moody sardonic and beautiful voice of thom yorke. the perfect mix of poprock and electronica. a concept album about the perils of technology o.k. computer experiments with concepts concerning everything from near-death experiences to alien abduction. this album really shines on tracks from the opener airbag to the closing epic the tourist. an album such as this will never be duplicated or eclipsed. not even by radiohead themselves. this album is better left unchallenged. released only five years ago in 1997 it has already made its mark in music history as possibly the greatest rock album of the modern pop era. an absolute masterpiece. radiohead is considered by critics as well as a world-wide cult of rabid fans to be one of the greatest bands in the history of rock. however this album only defines one period in radioheads multi-faceted history.,1
yo abbey road revolver abbey road again i am really happy for you and i am about to let you finish but rym says ok computer is the best album of all time! of all time!! edit alright semi-serious review time. there are many legitimate arguments that could be made for this not being the 1 album of all time. it was not as culturally influential as sgt peppers it did not spawn an entire genre like itcotck it did not push the musical envelope like velvet underground  niko and did not push the lyrical envelope like highway 61 revisited. what it did do however was combine influences from all these albums and more to make one of the most complete sounding albums ever created. what i mean by that is that each song works incredibly well both on its own and in context. each song instantly drags you into its own confusing schizophrenic sometimes melancholy and mournful world and never let us go yet when it is all over you can look back at the whole album and easily see where all the pieces fit so to speak. so no radiohead are not even close to being the most innovative rock group of all time but i will argue that they are simply one of the best. ok computer is the culmination of everything they had ever been working toward and it has affected me and many other gen xgen yers so profoundly that it is really no surprise that it is 1. i do not think it is flawless though. i would make 2 changes to this album if i could i would make fitter happier the first track i always though it was obviously an intro piece and replace electioneering with polyethylene from the airbag ep. really minor gripes though.,1
maybe too obvious... but exit music for a film contains a deliberate reference to the beatles back in the you.s.s.r the airbag drum track was intended to copy dj shadows endtroducing track 3 on that album esp. the great thing about subteranean homesick alien is that it sounds very similar to their bends b-sides which might be radiohead at their most original compare climbing up the walls with trickys pumpkin or hells around the corner.... fitter happier is totally original it is a riskier track than anything done by the pixies smiths u2 or rem or any other radiohead famous influence. you could still find comparisons to the beatles revolution 9just a more focused meaningful version. johnny greenwood only rips-off obscure stuff see penderecki messiaen lansky and other 20th c. composers so i do not know what the tourist is referencing. another track like the trickster and talk show host that i think find radiohead at their most original. if they ever made an album like that though the chance for this is probably long past i dare say it might make an even greater album than ok computer. they never even released big boots and the we are all grown up now version of big ideas they did release is not the one they might have in 1999. that is my most scathing review of okc ever,1
finally a radiohead experience i can actually get behind. and why is that? it is because they have stopped trying so hard to be a guitar band and instead are shooting for commercial suicide at least capitol thought as much when radiohead delivered the final product to them. honestly the music is still pretty firmly grounded in 90s alternative rock it is just that now they are more interested in electric pianos echo-y drum kits loops samples crescendoing aka starting a song minimally and then slowly building it up and piecing different sections together to make longer weirder songs. the old style is still around on exactly one song the straight-up rocker electioneering which usually gets singled out as being the weak link but i like it just fine in fact if any radiohead song could be called underrated it would be this one. the other sore thumb is of course fitter happier two minutes of a computerized voice saying stupid shit like on sundays ring road supermarket and car wash and yes this is as pointless as everyone thinks it is. nearly every other song though good or bad and they are mostly all good contains at least a few elements that radiohead have not tried before. for example if airbag sounds a little weird or off it is because that drum take is not actually being played it is 5 seconds or so of a phil selway sample being looped. if climbing up the walls sounds weird too it is probably because the string section handled entirely by jonny greenwood features 16 different violins playing quarter tones apart from each other. i cannot say that every decision works to their advantage - the tourist is shooting for a super spacey sound but unfortunately not much happens during its 5 minutes. and even though i like the song karma police is one of the more blatant rip-offs of another song i have heard sexy sadie by the beatles. on a different note thom is starting to develop that over-emoting style of his moaning and drawing out every syllable over two or three bars longer than he needs to and i am basically indifferent here i do not dislike the tone of his voice but his vocals will start to grate on me if the musics boring. fortunately the level of writing and arranging was really kicked up a notch on ok computer and i am happy to admit this is almost kind of worthy of the hype.,1
there is really nothing to be said it is already been said. anyone who is a fan of music music history or just human emotion needs an encounter with the masters of each radiohead. and ok computer is the place to start nestled in between their old and new sounds of music. perfect from start to finish each song is a polished gem. i like to listen to the album from start to finish but starting with paranoid android and ending with airbag. that why the person described in the album dies with the tourist and is born again with airbag.,1
fui muy recalcitrante a escuchar este disco tal vez por esa costmbre que tiene el ser humano a huir a las nuevas esteticas y sobrevalorar lo pasado y subestimar lo presente pero la verdad que este disco me volo la cabeza el mejor disco de las ultimas dos decadas sin lugar a dudas.,1
definitely not radioheads most unconventional album but it still leaves an impact- mainly one of loneliness. tracks no surprises and let down are especially so. however in paranoid android and electioneering we see radiohead still knows how to rock.,1
up until a couple of years ago i had only heard two radiohead songscreep and myxomitosis which i did not like i did not understand what the hubbub was about concerning radiohead. i found this album for a few bucks at a 2nd hand store and thought i might as well buy it and it completely blew me away. a classic album were every song has its value,1
   -  the bends.          .,1
hold on radiohead. i would like my sanity back. wow.,1
radiohead-ok computer radioheads follow up to the bends sees them refining the pop approach for an extremely ambitious wider concept album even if the band disagrees. gone are the personal lyrics and pop song structures arriving are the multi-sectional pieces with a wide variety of instruments piano strings mellotron and more and encompassing lyrics of death alienation and the dullness of everyday life. the biggest difference between pablo honey and the bends is the quality of the songwriting but the biggest difference between the bends and ok computer is undoubtedly the scope. most important to that scope is the sequencing of the album with airbag and lucky being the first and penultimate tracks respectively both songs tell the story of a man who survived a vehicular accident and provide a sense of the importance of life which all the songs in between focus on in different ways be it overreaction and happy-go-lucky people who do not give enough thought to their action paranoid android alienation subterranean homesick alien or dissatisfaction with a maladroit life no surprises. only the albums closer the tourist breaks away from the theme and yorke takes a trip back to the bends and begins talking to himself telling himself to slow down a glimpse of what was to come with kid a. paranoid android is a three-section song influenced by happiness is a warm gun and bohemian rhapsody. karma police is split into two sections and uses repetition without a chorus. fitter happier is a monotonous reading from a computer about a perfect figure which turns out to be a lab animal. climbing up the walls is driven by a large string section and bug sounds. ok computer is not just one of the most ambitious albums ever it is one of the most needlessly ambitious albums ever. the bends was a fantastic album that once again redefined what pop songwriting was capable of arguably the the joshua tree or the queen is dead of its decade in that regard. but the band was not satisfied with just a pop album and so they gave us something completely different that maintained the quality of songwriting. while the bends utilizes similar styles on each song and relies heavily on distinct riffs melodies and rhythm lines to differentiate songs ok computer relies on different instruments and changes to the key and time signatures. only electioneering seems to be unable to find its own identity in radioheads catalog but that only means it is unique to the album and the song is more than good enough to have been on the bends had it been written already. aside from the hubble ok computer might have the largest scope of anything we can experience. so is ok computer perfect? far from it. despite the ambition of the lyrics they often fall short in successfully penetrating the listeners hearts. the great thing about personal lyrics is that humans for the most part have the same emotions and someone can relate to a piece of art written in that state of mind. the bends is far from a lyrical masterpiece but it is extremely easy to relate to. social commentary on the other hand has to be articulate and find a way to give its message through a personal issue. and if my thought-dreams could be seenthey would probably put my head in a guillotinebut it is alright ma it is life and life only. not everyone in fact not anyone can be bob dylan but for such a scope he should at least be able to give us an i do not want to take what you can givei would rather starve than eat your breadall the things that others want for mecannot buy what i want because it is free. yorkes lyrics are occasionally haunting climbing up the wall but more often too abstract to really be effective paranoid android karma police. furthermore no song is able to match the best on the bends which in and of itself is not a bad thing because of the strength of its songs but the reason is indeed a problem for the album. radiohead was so focused on unique sounds from song to song that they never seemed to have created the best song they could in any style they attempted. if they wanted a certain atmosphere to carry through the album they would only truly go for it a couple times and if pablo honey taught us anything it is that radiohead needs practices to master their technique. ok computer never gave itself that chance and the subsequent kid a is too busy trying to do its own thing to cash in on all the great things that this still magnificent album gives us. for all its flaws ok computer is still a great album and it only seems to get stronger and stronger as you know the songs better. the surprise and excitement of hearing a new style the first couple times is eventually overtaken for the desire to understand just why a song is so different and that is when ok computer really shines. when you can listen to an album and then not realize how much there is to it until you start to break it down with words you know you have got yourself an album and it is probably better than you thought it was when you heard it. why not give it a try? spin ok computer write about it and spin it again. rating 4.255 yeah i went there bsfta let down electioneering,1
le pongo cinco estrellas y es un gran disco  pero aun asi digo que es un disco muy sobrevalorado ver que esta en el puesto 3 de los mejores discos de la historia me hace reir .,1
when i first heard this album i did not quite get it. it is one of many recommendations i took from this site. paranoid android clicked quite well and is my favourite song to date. the rest of the album did not get me and i kept trying and trying due to advice i took from here. i got it after about 3-4 listens. this is beautifully produced and extremely well written music. even if the band cannot play very well. i love to play the music from this album on guitar and it sounds great and is quite easy for me to play. this is a great album and everyone should try at least to listen to it even if you do not get it favourites paranoid android exit music lucky,1
my second favorite album! not their best ! and no my favorite album is not the bends...i do not understand why radiohead fans always have to go back and forth with these two. i personally think in rainbows is by far their best! but like i said many times that is just my personal taste! here it is my ratings from least favorite to favorite 12. fitter happier ......not a song!!!....thank you very much...cannot even rate it....but i love what it says. no rating 11. climbing up the walls i like the manipulation of the voice...but a bit flat of a song. 510 10. electioneering ok song but i could pass...good for classic rock and roll lovers. 5.510 9. lucky we are just lucky to have radiohead...good song. 710 8. the tourist i love how it starts very slow then the voice just comes out! 810 7. let down reminds me of time after time by quietdrive...so i like it. 810 6. no surprise love the intro...but it gets a little repetitive great song though. 8.510 5. airbag love the style and use of vocals here...8.510 4. paranoid android one complaint...tooooo looong of a song.other than that love it much! 8.510 3. exit music for a film very deep and dark song! 248-end! magnificent! 910 2. karma police well as i am sure most people know this song i do not need to make a comment. 910 1. subterranean homesick alien the most underrated song by radiohead period! i can go on with this song! the best one of the album! the guitar work it is just magical it takes you to another planet...the soothing vocals and the perfect lyrics together make one of radioheads best songs. give this song a try if you do not like it at first. 1010!!!!!!,1
i have listened to this album so many times i do not even need to look at the song listing for reference 1. airbag 1010 one of the greatest. the drumming and bass puts you in a groove that is monumentally different than everything else. 2. paranoid android 1010 best song on the album. a suite of 3 different parts all featuring amazing harmonies guitar work a greaaaat solo and little details that you notice a new one every time you listen. 3. subterranean homesick alien 910 a great one. the chorus gets stuck in my head all the time. 4. exit music for a film 9.510 this song has a great melody and haunting back-up vocals. brilliant. 5. let down 8.510 i listened to this once when i was sad. i felt yorke was singing to me. 6. karma police 1010 for a minute there i lost myself. tell me that did not get stuck in your head right then. 7. fitter happier 510 could do without it but very cool. a good pause and a segway in the middle of the album like treefingers on kid a. 8. electioneering 910 great lyrics. great riff. 9. climbing up the walls 9.510 shivers 10. no surprises 1010 lyrics are amazing. amazing placement on the album. good great brilliant. 11. lucky 1010 took me a couple listens to get it but once i got it... i got it. 12. the tourist 810 closes with a bang 90 overall. 3 for message 93 average one of my top 3 albums ever.,1
the best album that has ever graced my ears. monumental in shaping my taste in music.,1
i am by no means a radiohead fan but this cd has the feel of a classic album. ok computer just has it that x factor that makes a great album a classic. everything i feel in my gut in my head in my heart when i listen to a classic album i feel when i listen to this album. it is really incredible. this is probably the lamest review i have ever written and i doubt it will make the front page but i am going with my gut here. classic album--has yet to be surpassed by anything that came after it.,1
o.k. computer is an excellent album but falls short of perfection with me for a couple of reasons. the first 8 tracks are radiohead at their best and have me thinking that this is the best album they have ever made but the last 4 are a disappointment for me. i am not a fan of climbing up walls while the other three tracks are good but nowhere near the quality of the first 8. airbag is a better version of planet telex from the bends and the themes of the album may seem like nothing new but at the time were unique. thoms vocals are good as always and the instrumentation is complex yet accessible. overall it is a great album not my favorite by radiohead but still one of the best albums of the 90s. favoritesparanoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police no surprises,1
an indisputable masterpiece. to suggest otherwise is laughable and anyone who gives this album a half star rating should say good-bye to their credibility because it is out the window. standout tracks no surprises let down karma police and paranoid android.,1
one of the life-changing albums. every note is amazing every song pierces your mind the artwork is stupendous and the amount of emotions put into the whole album is beyond expression. everything else i could say about it goes without saying.,1
for sure one of the best albums ever made this has a lot to offer.,1
ok computer is one of those crazy albums where you can listen to the songs in any order and it still retains the greatness of the original track arrangement. it would not surprise me if let down is played at the pearly gates.,1
once you surrender your ears to the jangle of greenwoods guitar obrians controlled rhythm greenwoods tamed bass selways multi-dimensional drums and the chime of yorkes voice you find yourself on a journey through dimensions of melancholic beauty. mesmerizing galaxies spin around your head as you sway through the space dust. you know your body is secured on the face of the earth however your mind is racing away through colourful atmospheres. some radiate bright colours making you feel joyous. others dimmer darkly making you ponder on some elements of life such as social disconnection and the importance of empathy. sailing through this metamorphosing realm for 53 minutes and 27 seconds i gurantee if you approached this album with clarity in mind you will find a sort sonic nirvana if you will within the immeasurable depths this album scales. for what radiohead conceived here is a genuine masterpiece. an assorted collection of utter audio delights. the spacious spheres of airbag seeps into the multi-dimensional paranoid android a masterpiece controlling the time shifts majestically while unleashing the tension it had brewed so perfectly before floating back down to sanity. this and the successor the peaceful and disconnected subterranean homesick blues only paint a portion of a portrait of the sheer tapestry radiohead crafted. exit music for a film delivers yorke at his most vocally haunting while let down is a downright downhearted anecdote only perked up by those tremendously furbished solemn guitar notes. karma police is perhaps the most accessible song on the album a fairly straightforward piano-driven art piece which lends a leg of melody to sexy sadie. nonetheless it is by all means a perfect art rock song a defining article of the genre. poetic and quirky lyrics a definitive melody this song alone has inspired plenty of acts over the past decade. fitter happier is the interlude of the whole ok computer scheme the fabricated intelligence of the song failing to deliver emotional drive whatsoever crashing and crumbling down upon itself as we acknowledge the definitive distinction between machine and man is defined via emotion. electioneering nods at the bends-era radiohead the tune crashing it is way through political concourse before collapsing at the feet of the eerie and unsettling climbing up the walls perhaps the only song to rival exit music for a film as the most haunting tune on the track. it is a twisting tail of paranoia that simply self-destructs at 307 into a distorted synthetic oblivion. and then this bleeds into the absolutely beautiful ok computer trilogy which proceeds with no surprises just a sad downward spiral through ambient notes pampering us softly as we descend down the avenue of pessimistic despair. it is one of the most effulgent articles of emotion stirring music recorded the gentle keys capturing melancholy in its finest sonic disguise. the equally fantastic lucky was the first radiohead song that really grabbed my attention all those years back and it was also surprisingly one of the first songs the band recorded with nigel godrich who would become their chief producer. it is a brilliant melody that slowly builds fulfilling yorkes protagonist with an invaluable abundance of optimism hauling himself out of the wreckage that could be interpreted as a number of things from the obvious physical object to life. and sadly we approach the final destination on the musical voyage the sympathetic harmony of the tourist slowly absorbing us into its spiralling sphere encapsulating every last breathe of bitter-sweet elements the album had to offer constructing a spiral staircase which will guide us gentle out of the album and kiss us with a delicate ping before evaporating into thin air. to be honest it is quite hard to describe the album. my words alone cannot quite reflect what a dramatic influence this album has had upon the development of me as a person and as a music fanatic. hopefully one day these words will come to me a day i can pronounce myself as god perhaps. key tracks airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist overall 96.3636 therefore 55,1
one of the best record of our times. that is enought? right? every single piece of music here is really superb and it is not only alternative rock it is a mix and that is make ok computer one of the greateast albums at least in the last 20 years.,1
this is the best album i have ever heard. let down makes me cry every single time i hear it. as one of my dearest friends so eloquently put it this album sounds like thom yorke has been through the worst human sadness imaginable. i have never heard a more earnest display of human emotion. i love this album.,1
nobody can turn the soulless suburban existence into an enjoyable listening experience like radiohead can. this album is just outstanding one of the best albums ever no ifs ands or buts except for the tourist which was inexplicably included instead of several far better songs that ended up as b-sides. this is not an album to be passed up and anyone who claims it is too pretentious and intellectual probably cannot count to 3. highlights airbag paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls,1
ok computer is even better than the bends i did not think that was possible. it is absolutely flawless with layered atmospherics and obscure and enigmatic lyrics compliments of thom yorke whose ghostly falsetto fits them like a glove. this is not a happy album. in fact it is downright depressing. but it is a wonderfully crafted release. every song has a place on my mp3 player except for maybe fitter happier. the specific highlights include paranoid android a great sprawling epic made of many parts electioneering an absolutely furious rant on who-knows-what thoms vocals are impossible to understand and the terrifying climbing up the walls you cannot understand thom on this one either this would soon become normal on radiohead records. airbag is a layered sonically neat track and is the happiest song on the album funny it is about narrowly avoiding a car crash. exit music for a film is dramatic and intense and the tourist sounds like pink floyd in their heyday and is a great closer to a great album. this is the best album in radioheads catalog. it is the best mix of their electronic and guitar driven sounds and is the place to start with the band.,1
tired of depressing music. there is more to life than this. there is more to life than this.,1
paranoid android. in the first half of the dark track every odd sound that could be imagined comes into play from sambas and maracas to computerized background vocals. foreboding lyrics such as ambition makes you look very ugly and when i am king you will be the first against the wall litter the entire track and it inspires thought and provokes startling images not yet found in other music i have heard. and then in the middle of this grand majestic devious song the band explodes in a barrage of anger and aggression. fast guitar rifts and tumbling drums utterly come out of nowhere and sweep the listener away. the song goes on for quite a long time almost 7 minutes in fact but it feels like seconds and you will probably end up listing to it over and over again. paranoid android and airbag are not the only two tracks that make ok computer such a fun album to listen to far from it in fact. . subterranean homesick alien is a bizarre and very quirky song with echoing guitar rifts and odd keyboard playing that makes this song tend to stand more on the lighter side for the entire cd. exit music for a film is a deeply moving slow and acoustic track that finishes off with an electronic guitar that seems to glow with self-contempt and anger. let down is a medium paced and pleasant song that has superb lyrics and ingenious use of keyboards. karma police a song very much influenced by the beatles sexy sadie and the ending of this track sounds a lot like the beatles flying. fitter happier is a computerized voice and assortment of electronic sounds coming together in narrative that speaks of the perfect era of life and the lack of imperfection that comes with it. truly it is the social core of ok computer that speaks of the flaws that come with government control over humanity. the rest of the tracks are in their own rights amazing and probably some of the best songs i have heard in my entire life or will ever hear for that matter. they do not quite stand out like the first portion of the cd but that does not make them any less great just not recognized.,1
my word!! this is the best album of the 90s!!! radioheads definitive work ok computer is like tossing david bowie old u2 and lots of pink floyd into a blender. it combines their excellent guitar work from the bends  their later electronic work on kid a  amnesiac. its heavily layered and there is always something new to discover with each successive listen. it is packed with electronica rhythms eerie keyboards and odd time signatures. every song has its own unique beauty. my god i have given this record over 50 spins over the years and i still love it!,1
ed obrien about recording ok computer maybe the record sounds really different from everything else because we were not listening to everything else. before we went to record we were listening to stuff like dj shadow underworld ennio morricone marvin gaye and early pink floyd. then when we were in the studio there was a conscious decision to shut ourselves off from music because you can get panic attacks. i have done that before. i once put on london calling by the clash and i thought god how can anybody beat this album. we might as well just give up now. so we do not do that anymore because it is bad for morale. that is how you beat it.,1
do not know what else to say strangely i strongly disliked radiohead at first then well they grew and grew over years and years. pretty brilliant stuff. and this album tops them all.,1
one of the best albums of all time. paranoid android still gives me shivers.,1
i got ok computer about a year ago. after about 5 listens the whole thing just clicked. it really hit hard. even though i was over a decade late listening to this i was still blown away by it. it is reputation is impossibly high yet it still blew me away. it consists of 12 very unique songs 12 songs that each have their own personality. each song is incredible and the ideas contained within each one are finely tuned and potent. i have wondered for quite a while what i would say when i reviewed this. it is such a fantastic and landmark album that has been examined and reviewed so many times. anything that could be said about this album has been said countless times before. there is nothing new that i can say about this album there are no new insights or understandings that i can share. all i can say is this this album is just as incredible as everyone says. ok computer truly deserves the acclaim it has received countless times.,1
undoubtedly one of most creative epic and sonically original albums of all time. thom yorkes voice can haunt you like a ghost and wrap you up like a blanket all at the same time. the lyrics are at times ridiculous and obtuse at other times painfully touching. the album takes about five listens or so to sink in but it is absolutely worth it. any band that can write an album about how technology dehumanizes us with such warmth and bredth deserves more than a pat on the back. it is difficult to articulate how amazing this album is. in a word...brilliant! oh...and may i submit paranoid android as coolest rock song ever?,1
uno de los discos ms grandes que he oido nunca. cuesta varias escuchas cogerle el punto pero con paciencia acabas observando su gran calidad y su gran cantidad de matices.,1
a revolutionary album that succeeds in several ways the writing is brilliant the melodies are consistently haunting and beautiful and with a guitar-based architecture that cemented radioheads status as one of the best guitar-driven bands ever. it is also on this album that thom yorke begins to garner recognition as a talented vocalist. no doubt about it a masterpiece.,1
i gave this cd 5 stars because this album is and was a huge leap forward for them. it helped lead the way to kid a and amnesiac. but at the time this was a completely new sound for them this is when they started to get into all the electronics synthesizers and other effects that made them famous. my personal favorite off of this cd is paranoid android. this is definitely an album that people should have because its weird music the way its supposed to be done.,1
i think that this album is a perfect mix of the bends and kid a. probably because they wrote it between them... obviously i think the style is the best of what radiohead has to offer. paranoid android is a great rock song. i like music that moves and that song moves... giving off emotion and feeling the entire way. the album as a whole is great so do not just listen to one song.,1
quite possibly the greatest rock band to come out in my lifetime.,1
unbelievable album. it took me a few listens to truly appreciate the depth and genius of ok computer but the repeated exposure paid off and now i throw it in all the time and just listen to it straight through then go back to whatever musical mood i happen to be in. what can i say that has not already been said... its a masterpiece.,1
an exception of an album that has to be in my case listened a few times before it starts growing to biblical heights. art of modern rock vs. electronica itself. a classic nonetheless.,1
amazing. absolutely amazing. the alltogether sound of the songs on this album are breathtaking dauntng and awe- inspiring. i recommned ok computer to anyone and everyone.,1
evidently one of the best rock albums ever made. and i am not saying that by any influence it is simply a gorgeous genius and inspired record. the mixture of sadness eletronica flowing sounds and rhythm makes this album a obligatory reference to anyone who are interested in knowing how music should be dealt with respect love and creativity. put this record on close your eyes and feel what it can make for you... nothing compares to it.,1
this in an album of absolute transcendental beauty. undoubtedly this is the album that i have listened to the most and somehow i am still not bored with it. as soon as airbag kicks in it has me grinning at the world as strange electrical impulses wizz round may head making me feel alive in a way that is unsurpassed. i got this album the day it came out back when i was only 15. from that moment on things were never the same again. i listened to it from the beginning got as far as exit music and then listened to that one track about 20 times in a row in fits of excitement as i felt thoms voice speak to me in ways i would never known before. i then spent the next 2 years listening to ever nuance of this album. since then i have come a long way and my tastes have changed dramatically but i know that i will always be able to come back to ok computer and love it. it seems to me that this is an album that you really have to absorb yourself in and allow it to take control. those who do not rate is as 1 probably find it hard to do this and so cannot see it for what it is. sometimes i really pity thom yorke and his chums because as authors of this immense work they probably cannot grasp how remarkable it is.,1
the sequel to the bends and just as good. i love radiohead and i love this album. my favorite song would have to be no suprises and the classic karma police but it is hard to single out songs when the entire album is a masterpiece.,1
you cannot deny this brilliant album a place amongst the very best. they manage to take you to a futuristic crepuscular place which has enormous beauty but will never be your home.,1
there was a time that i did not hold out much hope for music. then i heard ok computer. this record reminds me of everything i look for in great music.,1
nothing flows better then the voice of thom yorke and his fellow musicians on this album. a truly beautiful moment in music at the time. radiohead is a band of genius capablilities and this is evident in the work of ok computer. if you want music to remind you of the night sky or the universe this is truly the stuff. stand out tracks karma police paranoid android subterranean homesick alien no suprises and lucky.,1
brilliant. absolute genius distilled on to a plastic disc.,1
first of all i would like to say that other peoples opinions about music almost never mean anything. with that said i am going to verbally squeeze every bit of life from ok computer until the album is nothing more than a frisbee. if you are ever tired bored depressed sick confused overwhelmed scared lonely sad or just hate life turns the lights out plug in your headphones and let thom yorke remind you that the whole world is secretly mourning with you. let the echoing guitars and magnanimous choral backgrounds yearn with you. let the xylophones play you a lullaby. you will feel much better. this album is there when you need it most. it does not promote the band it promotes your soul. it is your teddy bear but it is alive so do not squeeze it too hard or it will run away and never come back. then you will hate yourself... and the album.,1
greatest album of all time. period! the opening bass line on airbag let us you know you are in for a real treat.,1
this is edgy atmospheric rock at its best. this radiohead album is less poppy that pablo honey and the bends and takes their led zepplinpink floyd-inspired sound to new levels. the compositions are denser but not so arthouse that they are lost on most listeners. kharma police is one of their most realized pieces moving from a creepy low tempo to one of thom yorkes ghostly wails. the band is going for the sound of an electronicantiseptic world and they pull it off chillingly.,1
a great record this and radioheads best to date. experimental without being anal or atonal forward looking and backward looking big small loud quiet beautiful monstrous and charming. not for everyone perhaps but certainly the best album by any band to come out of the 90s british rock scene.,1
one of the best albums of the 90s the sheer amount of work that was put into ok computer is evident on every single song. with dreamy guitars and excellent production throughout it might take a while to get used to but boy it just moves you so much once you realise its beauty. i love every song on here apart from fitter happier but then that is just a halfway breather to get over the sheer brilliance preceding and following it. the opening song airbag starts with a strange bassy riff from jonny his guitar turning to cello every once in a while while ed obrian plays pleasant arpeggios over the top. with its strange production effects and complex arrangements this song works as a perfect opener for the album. after the car crash survival of airbag we get to hear one of the albums most epic songs the humorous paranoid android probably also the only song that has lyrics that seem pretty random and not about much yet still used in a way that you can say the lyrics are good - that is what a genius thom yorke is. the song itself starts of with a groovy beat that leads into ferocious guitar duels between jonny greenwood and ed obrian and a slow second half with vocals overlapping one another until another smash of guitar solos ends the track - amazing. then comes the aquatic-sounding subterranean homesick alien about alien abduction with a jazzy verse and beautiful chorus. exit music for a film comes next. a story about two lovers escaping from a over-protective father based upon romeo and juliet this song is slow and some say it is depressing but i find it is morbid undertones actually quite beautiful. when thom begs his lover to breathe keep breathing while an electronic choir sings in the background it sends shivers down my surprise. it took me a while to like the next track let down but both the lyrics and the chorus are quite beautiful and at the end there are several vocals overlapping at once with all the instruments going as well showing a clear example of just how complex radiohead can make their music. karma police at first seems like quite a humorous song with it is slow but catchy chorus but the second half of the song is beautiful and jonnys piano playing sounds great. fitter happier is basically an interval although the instruments behind the robotic voice sound nice if a little depressing. electioneering is a more conventional rock song with a good chorus and a great guitar solo at the end. climbing up the walls is dark and eerie with rising strings and a horn solo. no surprises is a nice nursery rhyme-type song with poetic lyrics and a pleasant instrumental section. lucky is a brilliant song with the chorus a beautiful cry for help from yorke with superb guitar playing from jonny. this kind of seems like radioheads comfortably numb if you ask me. the albums outro the tourist is considered by many not as good as the rest of the album. admittedly it is nowhere near as complex or as compressed but i actually quite like the way it is open and spaced out. it is like you have been compressed and isolated throughout the album and at the end it is letting you out with a nice easy song to listen to. overall ok computer is in my opinion radiohead at their very best and finest moment. consistent throughout it is a dreamy and fantastic soundscape of wonderful music and i would certainly recommend it to those who have not heard it yet.,1
back in 1997 i had heard so much about radiohead that i needed to see what all the hype was about. all i knew about them was the song creep because everyone knew it. i had the bends  but somehow i never got around to listening to it and i kind of forgot i even owned it. i was really interested in listening to ok compyter so when i bought it and got in my car i listened to the cd immediately curiosity had gotten the best of me. i immediately understood that this album was exceptional. i consider myself a person with very good taste in music. i appreciate many different kinds of music ranging anywhere from classical to rap to nu-metal to eastern music except country music. when i listened to this album for the first time i felt like i had to listen to it over and over. after listening to this album several times i listened to the bends and immediately saw their seemingly natural progression to ok computer. the bends is a very very good album but it is of the same type of guitar music that was popular at the time i.e. oasis blur smashing pumpkins. ok computer takes the bends and mellows it out with sweeping guitars and oftentimes dreamy melodies. add electronica mixed with thom yorkes passionate vocals and you get somewhat of an idea of what this album is about. i realize that there are people out there who dislike radiohead and that is ok. i am not trying to convert anyone to be their fan. but i really do think that this album is sophisticated and ground-breaking and deserves a chance to be listened to. my personal opinion of radiohead the beatles experimented with music and the world got brilliance. radiohead as a band do not follow and create top 40 type of music. radiohead do choose to grow and move into different directions and with each album they definitely accomplish that. many bands and musicians follow and create the same type of music in their time period and that music is ok for many people yet few choose to make their own path because it might mean less popularity less sales etc.. and therefore these period bands go with what is tried and true. they are the bands that release album after album of the same type of music. never evolving often stagnant. i think this band will be remembered for their originality and although maybe not extremely popular meaning on the radio in our day and age they will have opened the door for a new music yet to come.,1
after the critical acclaim of radioheads previous masterpiece the bends from 1995 there was a lot of pressure for them to deliver the goods for a second time in a row. while most critics were probably expecting the band to produce a good album i am sure the majority did not expect it to be as good as it turned out. the first hints as to what the album might sound like came from the first single and second track on the album- the six and a half minute paranoid android- an amazing series of ideas ranging from percussive melancholic quiet sections to extremely loud pixies style guitar work. i feel it is undoubtedly the albums true highlight. with the exception of android and the angry political electioneering influenced by elvis costello and featuring more jagged guitar playing the album falls into three sections- slow majestic ballads melancholy acoustic laments and more experimental electronic tracks. opener airbag is probably the most successful of the more experimental songs- its strange cut up drum patterns and flanged guitars evoking technological breakdown. track nine climbing up the walls is another strange song featuring a radio being tuned in the background against a menacing synth bass line and gently strummed guitars. the two acoustic based songs on offer are immensely poignant- especially exit music for a film which was influenced by shakespeares romeo and juliet. it builds to an immensely powerful climax featuring fuzz bass and a raw drumbeat which never fails to send a chill down the spine whenever it is played. the majority of the album however is taken up by a series of amazing majestic ballads. the most effective of these in my opinion are the smiths inspired let down and the epic closer the tourist. on both of these tracks the guitars chime beautifully and the choruses brim with emotion. many have imitated this kind of song writing but none have managed to produce better music than these particular tracks in my opinion. the album closes beautifully with a trio of amazing songs- no surprises lucky and the aforementioned the tourist. the chime of a triangle at the very end of this last track was the perfect way to end radioheads peak album.,1
now that is an album. actually gets better with every listen. first class. a true statement of lyrical and musical genius. anyone who does not rate this can smell my cheese.,1
this is the best album of the 1990s - i know everyone says so but it is true. i cannot lie.,1
it is amazing how ok computer can really bring you up or put you down. i think it is the best album ever made. i listen to all kinds of music but radiohead is definitely my personal favorite. i think the two most important songs in this album are paraniod android and exit music for a film. i can listen to the entire cd a hundred times a day. this last song exit makes me feel passionate. i can feel the sadness and rage in thom yorke. how many have to do that? run away from home because of peoples ...rules and wisdom... i agree... i hope that they all choke!,1
if i had to choose one cd this would be it a true classic in every way the best cd to listen to on headphones ground breaking stuff.,1
in the day and age of the pop-radio single radiohead managed to create a sonic masterpiece that spanned an entire album. from the vaguely disconcerting opener airbag to the soaring guitars of subterranean homesick alien to the almost abrasive second half of paranoid android they manage to lure the listener into an alternate world of a stark battle between man and machine. called the dark side of the moon of the 90s ok computer firmly established radiohead as one of the premiere rock bands of the past 10 years. with new meaning unearthed upon repeated listenings this album is sure to have staying power well beyond its shelf life.,1
like this is the first time i have been all about a song that was mucho overplayed on the radio karma police and i still love the thing years later without even thinking about it. they are so up there as one of the greatest bands right now.,1
in my opinion the true test of great music is time. some albums are great because they capture a certain age but then the listener in decades to come may find it hard to relate to the lyrics and feel. ok computer is special because it certainly does capture an age but i feel listeners in years to come will still be able to listen and understand the message. this is because ok computer is about a situation and depression in our world that is worsening daily and will continue to do so with the development of machine by man. ok computer describes a world has no faith in god or others where humankind is speedily evolving into a heartless computer-brained technology-governed society. the songs describe aliens plane crashes a young boy rescuing his love from her cruel fathers fortress haunting by demons robots- imagine star wars with a beautiful script it is hard to i know. this album at first seems like the biggest downer however once you start listening to the lyrics it becomes something more. the most amazing collection of songs i have ever heard and i am sure it is message about our cold society will apply just as effectively in fifty years from now.,1
radioheads masterpiece is here. this has a deep and textured atmosphere and has masterfully crafted lyrics to compliment it.,1
well everyone knows this one already. what an incredible piece of music both for listening to and simply based off of its predictive merit. certainly one of the very best albums ever recorded not much else to say on this one. all-time,1
number 1 overall jesus i mean its good - like really good. had a huge impact i like thom yorkes vocals the lyrics theme etc. solid record but i can understand why people cannot stand the idea that radiohead is popular or rated so highly airbag pranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police,1
that is literally the best album of radiohead in my opinion it is an album that makes you cry and at the same time you can feel like you are a maniac!!! the melody of the instruments match with his voice somebody call the karma police to arrest this creep!!,1
radioheads magnum opus and third album ok computer is what really put them on the map the album starts with airbag it is about a car crash feeling born again after almost dying and how technology affects us it does a good job of setting up the cold atmospheric themes that show up later on the album. subterranean homesick alien is really freaking good alien theme is interesting too. let down is... underrated karma police is... overrated electioneering is the weakest on the album for me kind of generic really noisy without actually doing much. climbing up the walls is chilling and really great overall. the album ends mellowly with the tourist a fitting end to a masterpiece that would be followed up by their best album.,1
i do not think this is the best album of all time as it is rated as on here. but it is undeniable how good this album is. no surprises is probably my second or third favourite song ever.,1

this album is really interesting and one that i enjoyed a lot shining with its immense instrumentals and having really good vocals that i did not expect to like as much as i did. the highlights were paranoid android my favorite track from the album by far exit music for a film i really liked the choral elements of this one and electioneering. the tracks that did not work as well for me were karma police and lucky which were a touch on the boring side for me. overall a really great album that had me interested the whole way through with stellar instrumentals and very good vocals.,1
you know those albums that get praised for delivering a message of empowerment and liberation well this is not one of those albums. no ok computer has a central theme beyond the obvious one of modern-day alienation it is that if you do not have realistic expectations then you will not be let down later in life. no it is all set out in very clear and correct art-rock letters this is you are assigned box to live out of you should reasonably expect this much and no more. if that leaves you feeling sore and disappointed truly sorry butt please try and find some solace in the fact that no one else is happy in this fact either. parlophone records disclaimer if this album puts you in a dissociative coma this does not violate your consumer rights,1
la generacin x fue testigo en tiempo real del significado artstico y el carcter innovador de este disco. el indie rock de su pera prima y las guitarras filosas de the bends no hicieron presagiar una evolucin tan asombrosa y cautivante como la que lograron en ok computer. el lbum fue un punto de inflexin en el mundo del rock una bomba snica y conceptual que estall en su firmamento y se expandi hacia los cuatro costados. el siglo veintiuno comenz aqu! ok computer ejerci una influencia seminal en la escena se dise a base de tcnicas de produccin modernas que envolvieron canciones meldicamente brillantes conect rock con electrnica capt como pocos lo que ocurra a su alrededor mezcl letras intimistas con sonidos robticos y fundi guitarras estridentes con bateras procesadas y sintetizadores crujientes. radiohead presagi en ok computer la era millennial por venir fue un hechizo del que todos sin tapujos tomaron algo. una verdadera obra maestra de principio a fin y un ensayo majestuoso de atmsferas angustiantes y estribillos picos. fue el disco de los 90 uno inmortal e inolvidable que con su impronta derrumb las barreras y prejuicios entre rock y mquinas por entonces retrgradamente imperantes. radiohead fue una banda que entendi el verdadero legado de los grandes bsqueda experimentacin y reinvencin. escarb en la periferia y como un sabio renacentista bebi de todas las fuentes desde su ms notorio influjo krautrock hasta las ltimas invenciones del idm evolucion como nadie de su era lo hizo y sostuvo en el tiempo una excelencia pocas veces vista. hoy hablamos de  sgt. pepper   ziggy stardust  y  dark side of the moon  nuestros hijos y los hijos de nuestros hijos preguntarn por l.,1
a victory for the worst of people nerds softboys and sad boys. unrivaled in its paranoid observations of the approaching 21st century. heaviest part is that it is really good. its so cinematic with all these exciting crescendos i cannot help but like it.,1
holy is this album a piece of art. from the bends to this is insane. i love the bends but this album is what pushed them from being just another 90s sad rock band with a few great songs to the best rock band of the 90s and 2000s. every track has zero flaws. the theme of the album is kind of like an impending doom and things moving to fast in life. radiohead was describing how society as a whole is relying on this new wave of technology and computers and man oh man did they predict the future. ok computer as in a demand. the intro track airbag describes getting in a car crash being killed by technology car. but that same technology airbag. saves his life. a paradox. this type of story telling carries through the whole album leaving the listened at a confused state about how the singer feels. every song has so many layers of instruments its a wall of noise but a refined one that does not blow your ears out and ties all together. every song has many different feelings and emotions in it and songs like paranoid android and karma police have a section in the song that sounds completely different from the rest but it still fits in perfectly. leaving you with multiple emotions at the end of the track. radiohead perfectly predicted the disturbing future in which people are relying on others and technology to much you would think this was an album from the 2010s. the outro track the tourist is very interesting. it talks about getting in a car crash. remember the intro track? but in the tourist it just ends. no airbag saves his life. you may interpret this in many ways is the whole album looping together and the tourist is just describing the crash from the airbag? or does the singer die and that is the end? the lyric they ask me where the hell i am going at 1000 feet per second makes me almost feel like the singer knows the answer and is crashing on purpose. i am not to sure but it ends this record fantastically with the listener having many questions. the instrumentation on every track is some of the best i have ever heard and thom yorke voice is just oh so perfect. one of the best rock albums ever and a staple in the music industry. 1010,1
radioheads 1997 album ok computer is one of the most important and influential albums of all time. it was a huge departure from their previous work and it showed the world that they were a band that was always evolving and pushing boundaries. the album starts off with airbag a song that is full of energy and showcases the bands new sound. it then transitions into paranoid android one of the most well-known and popular songs on the album. it is a six-minute song that is full of different sounds and changes and it is a perfect example of the bands ability to experiment. other standout tracks on the album include karma police lucky and no surprises. all of these songs are incredibly well-written and showcase the bands talent for creating emotionally powerful music. overall ok computer is an incredible album that is full of amazing songs. it is a must-listen for any fan of music and it is a album that will continue to be influential for years to come.,1
what more can i really say that has not already been said? it is been ryms favorite album for who knows how long. is it my favorite album? nah. it is really close however. most of the album is perfect in my opinion with two exceptions exit music for a film and let down. exit music was one of the first radiohead songs i have ever heard many years ago. but as time went by the song started to wear on me. let down would have been perfect if not for the seemingly random bleeping in the last quarter of the song. it is not that i do not like the song but i just cannot ignore it. but still there seems to be a lot of people who would say that let down is their favorite radiohead song and perhaps one day it will grow on me more as well. however even if one day i change my mind and give let down a 1010 exit music alone would stop me from giving this album a 10. well it is still an excellent album. strong 9,1
this one has really grown on me over time. i first listened to it in 2020 without any prior knowledge of radioheads discography and thought of it as a good but not extraordinary record. coming back to it after listening to their other masterpieces such as kid a amnesiac and in rainbows has really put this into perspective for me. other than that there is nothing i can add that has not been said a million times before about ok computer so i spare your time and leave the deep analysis to others. all i can really say is that it is an astounding piece of music that everyone with even a little interest in music should check out.,1
okay i never wanted to listen to this album or make a rating on here in fear of becoming and incel j. but anyways i did enjoy this album. it did at some moments seem like some of the songs sounded super similar. which is not that big a deal it is definitely the type of music that will grow on me the more i listen. radiohead  favorites 1. no surprises- me when i feel the feelings 2. electioneering- really picked on this one made me more engaged. 3. the tourist- it felt like a good solem ending ,1
every human being is hopeless alone. in the idiot 1869 myshkin is paralyzed by a terrible estrangement from others. he wishes to relief the suffering of others after being drive by the experience of beauty and harmony that precede his epileptic seizures. but others fail to guess myshkin inner reality. what about ok computer? here wee see thom yorke dealing with different themes and metaphors this allusion to myshkin illuminates a perspective that seeks to recognize the intentions of this brilliant album. ah yes starting with experimental work from radiohead. i am unsurprised to find out that this is the most popular album on rym the burst of electric guitar and insane synthesizers work here made me feel again the warm feeling of finding something new and having goosebumps in the first 10 listens. this is not a joke i may have listened to this album non stop for three whole days before start writing this itself consists of songs that are intricate take multiple listens to fully grasp. it is not hard to tell i liked it. rediscovering radiohead and yorkes lyrics composition years since my first listening to it gave me a lot of time alone to remember how much i like this band. lost in the limbo between the conceptual and collection of songs with themes of isolation the increased need for technology in the modern age  aliens  romeo and juliet  and even karma. ok computer brings so much more than this the truth is that the album is much more than songs without connection each track open a fracture into a central role in what is the final product. while it is difficult to say concretely that there is a logic sequence between each track we are induce straightforward to a sublime and predominant theme with an organic feel and deeply personal touch. there is a unity between the songs that shows a state of mind rather than a linear narrative or an explicit form. the state of mind mind here is living in the modern world with its emphasis on better living through science. and yet the 19th century notion of letting science and technology advances the human race into a better utopia has resulted in devastating wars and others forms of misery... far from being idyllic  peaceful. sentimentality is being emotional for the sake of it. we are bombarded with sentiment people emoting. that is the let down. feeling every emotion is fake. or rather every emotion is on the same plane whether it is a car advert or a pop song.  thom yorke the tracks are all brilliant in their own right but ones that really deserve mentioning would be lucky subterranean homesick alien and climbing up the walls are pretty much the downhole to me sink into the emotional numbness the harmonies at the end of lucky fill my chest with the urge to laugh and cry i know i have found a comfort track for all the overwhelming uncertainty confusion i have ever experienced just like millions of people. the album has something to give on every single track. one of the greatest albums of all time  what we all truly believe to be the best radiohead album to date.,1
01-02-22 a pesar de conocer a radiohead por el puro nombre y por creep duh no fue hasta hoy que escuche ok computer album que para muchos es su magnus opus y segun rate your music el mejor album de todos los tiempos. el album inicia algo flojo con el tema airbag a mi parecer no tiene momentos memorables al igual que los otros temas que estan plagados de ellos como por ejemplo el tema paranoid android que para mi es donde realmente inicia el album. no es ningun secreto que la produccion de las guitarras en este album es de otro nivel cada riff cada solo se siente lleno de poder y agresion que contrastan muy bien con la voz y las letras de tom. un punto muy fuerte del album son las letras y las melodas que son pegajosas a mas no poder y se nota la influencia que este album ha tenido en el landscape del rock y de la musica pop en general. los sintetizadores llenan de vida y color las pistas y la bateria tambien suena genial en general puedo decir que todos hacen un excelente trabajo. fuera del inicio del album cada cancion es impactante y energizante el pasing del album es muy bueno hay temas que duran 6 min y no se sienten para nada pesados aparte de que el album esta lleno de temas memorables como let down karma police no surprises. el ultimo tramo de 4 canciones del album fue mi favorito y a mi parecer cierra de una manera perfecta encapsulando los fuertes del album en una sola cancion. calificacion 9 canciones favoritas paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police electioneering climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist canciones menos favoritas airbag,1
i wish i could put into words what this album means to me. it was a landmark on my adolescenthood and made me go find it is references and it is origins. through this album i have gone to listen to the beatles pink floyd talking heads etc. - the classics and yet it did find itself drawing some ideas from those it still stands today as a piece of it is own. the is not much i can say about the music that has not been said. the whole band is in sync with the frustrations and anxieties that thom is desperately trying to express. i can even feel the discomfort in some songs nowadays even being so used to listening to them. the effects used some borrowed some created became almost the staple of the rock of 00s and 10s to the point in which we get bored every time a new band is born signing in the famous thoms falsetto or repeating the albums ideas as it is some formulas book for rock success - most of them are not that good not that effective and not that sincere. i get it when people say it is overrated. it is not. every album that shaped so much of an musical era ends up with this tag at some point. it is legacy in pop culture is palatable to the point that even the band itself is running away from it. we can make a list of everything that was born out of this album and from the very different sound that they would come to produce after it. from big bands that fill arenas like muse coldplay and maroon 5 to one-hit-wonders of the 00s as keane and new bands with potential like nothing but thieves almost in the wake of the 20s decade. i get it when people pick isolated songs and try to overanalyze them to say they do not sound as great nowadays. fitter happier or electioneering are good examples of that. however i choose to look at it as a whole as an experience as a vision of an era as a frustration being expressed as anxiety being put into words as we becoming less and less aware of how we were and are giving up of our own individualities - we became a bunch of alienated people who cannot discern the truth from the lies and that only care about our very own phones. and damn were not they right? ps. i am brazilian i am still practicing my english. sorry for any mistakes.,1
do not really know what i can say about this album that has not been said already. all i will say is that it is perfect from start to finish and is one of the greatest concept albums and one of the best albums of all time. airbag karma police and no surprises are my favorite tracks on the album. perfect 1010,1
s es un discazo. no no es el mejor disco de la historia. no no est entre los 5 mejores discos de la historia. no no est entre los 15 mejores discos de la historia. no no est entre los 25 mejores discos de la historia. seguramente no est ni entre los 50 mejores discos de la historia. un gran disco que a la vez por desgracia est altamente sobrevalorado.,1
i came into ok computer with a pretty negative attitude. i had tried to listen to pablo honey previously and had disliked it enough to tell everyone else i knew that radiohead were whiney and annoying. i now wish i had not. i began this album with my mind closed to changing opinions as i previously said and can admit that i found the first two tracks a bore. i found that reading the fairly basic lyrics off of my computer was not actually helping my enjoyment of the album so switched these off. when i had fully relaxed back and actually started to listen to the movements and flows of the music i became entranced into this sense of power that the album was radiating. the complex rhythms and tones enhanced the poor lyrics that i had been so focused on before hand. my first true moment of understanding came from the track subterranean homesick alien this slightly awed me. a mixture of guitar and piano this song haunted and also relaxed me. from this point on i looked at the album from a neutral perspective without former bias and i now understand why fans of this album enjoy it so much. personally i do not see this as the greatest album ever made. but i did not say it was not great. this album is a rollercoaster of emotions and rhythms all paired together by a group of strange electronic modern lyrics which feel like they are from another universe. i would advise all to listen to this album.,1
contrarians be like 010 this album is bad because its popular just ignore the music part,1
there are few top 100 albums of all time lists by internet sites or magazines that do not include radioheads ok computer often in the top 10 and sometimes even at 1. ok computer has not been touched by me for several years despite me knowing about its existence and how universally acclaimed it was. there are some reasons for that but all of them are bad eventually you could say it comes down to 15-year old me being an elitist punk and metalcore fan who would reject everything that is different. i remember asking somebody once why are all the albums that critics love bad? and thinking that radiohead was about the highest stage of pretentiousness. so that was me and maybe if it had not been for my friend heather that would still be me. she almost forced me to listen to ok computer and after some weeks of not really wanting to i gave in. first i fell in love with no surprises and karma police. i did not really get the rest of the album but it had a certain fascination. i listened to it again soon after when karma police happened to become the defining soundtrack in my life during the time of my proposal to my now fiance. now it seemed to make more sense to me and i liked it so much that i immediately ordered the cd. on several occasions i picked up the cd again and grew to love song after song the beautiful guitars in lucky the amazing bridge of paranoid android then exit music for a film after watching black mirror shut up and dance. now i do not think i would be able to tell why this album is so often considered the best album of all time i just know that in a way when i listen to it i feel it. this album has become an emotional rollercoaster for me. i do not even need to think about the lyrics though they are great and exit music for a film fills me with melancholy possibly the musically saddest song i have ever heard. the wonderful atmosphere of the tourist has me hooked until the last second of the album. ok computer is pretty much perfect and is a wonderful collage of different soundscapes and emotions held together by thom yorkes beautiful voice and jonny greenwoods stunning guitar sounds. now if i would go back and tell 16-year old me that one day ok computer will be one of my favourite albums i would probably tell myself to piss off. highlights lucky karma police exit music for a film,1
sitting down to write this review my first i open spotify search ok computer and tap shuffle play. when i look in the queue the first six songs are all downloaded onto a playlist on my account somewhere. as somebody who does not add songs for the fun of it at least not recently this is quite some achievement thom yorke and his not-so-merry men have accomplished. a deep dive into the album shows their ghostly view on the changing world through the lens of technology. the band combined this view alongside their place of recording a manor house to greatly extend their experimental side. airbag opens up the album a song i cannot seem to feel belongs to this album. had you played it in the middle of the bends or pablo honey i would not have battered an eye. however it is not a bad song at all instead a sort of message to their viewers that they were improving from the grunge sound of pablo honey alongside a few of their more rock-y tracks on the bends. this song also sounds as if it is in the same key as how to disappear completely probably the closest radiohead song to it actually. paranoid android follows behind and if someone were to ask me radioheads best song this would be a top pick. this and how to disappear completely and perhaps weird fishes. however the song perfectly portrays the three-way split in the mind and the swedish animation for the music video is a joy to watch. the subtle yet obvious time changes make this an objective masterpiece and a song that is almost destined to come up in a radiohead concert this and daydreaming no idea why though. subterranean homesick alien comes third and it is an extraterrastrial subnautical joy. thoms vocals sound shaky here however this gives way for the listener to enjoy the bubbly effects in the back which quickly become sharp jagged guitar to portray the dissonance of the alien and how he is lost in this world almost like i previously mentioned with thoms view on the changing world what the hell am i doing here i do not belong here lmao. alas exit music for a film. originally made for the romeo and juliet film in 96 however taken out and replaced. i am glad they did so. this week the song hit 100 million streams on spotify making it radioheads seventh song to do so. as the song starts the d major i think? guitar chords come in at least it was d major on the piano. thoms vocals really do wake you from your sleep and fill you with the dread of the future and what the afterlife brings us. pack and get dressed shows us that there is something after our physical life and the connotations of chaos and destruction around the word hell show that the world is conflicting with nature. the 130 mark gives us haunting background vocals as thom urges you to keep breathing as if you need to stay alive. after this there is a background noise of what seems to be a train warping around in the back before phil selway comes in with some gorgeous drums. this leads to a form of scale leading up to an f sharp note. this is orgasmic. the finish on exit music for a film is the best single piece of music i have ever heard. every one of the band performs it to perfection and thoms sustained notes let the others do their thing. if you could not tell this is my favourite song on this album and generally as well. let down. usually overlooked as it comes before the sledgehammer of karma police. a more uplifting song than exit music it is not hard is it?. very good piece of music and shows that this album is not all dreary. this is also an extremely underrated radiohead song in general and they usually play it as much as they can tour. the guitar sounds like the one they used on rems losing my religion cannot pin the name though. karma police. yes it is amazing. yes it is beautiful. yes it is radioheads most popular song creep does not exist in an ideal world. i like to think this and no surprises are twins. both very bittersweet pieces and shows thoms disgust at change in tradition a viewpoint perhaps of somebody elderly? this is what you get might be the most goosebump lyric to hear at their concert as the greenwoods like to turn off their guitars at this point. fitter happier. not much to say with electioneering. quite similar to airbag but the opening sounds a bit more jazzy. opening has the same notes as buns song burnout an underrated song. very fast paced changes the mood from karma police and turns the album around using the fencepost of fitter happier. this song gets the heart racing. climbing up the walls follows electioneering and it might be my least favourite song on the record. does not necessarily mean it is bad however sounds as if it belongs on amnesiac or king of limbs. the fuzzy vocals provide a heart-jaggering coldness to the track and this might provide some dissonance to the track which follows. who knows? ahaha. no surprises. my second gateway song to radiohead. might be the most recognisable opening to a radiohead song maybe after creep i do not know. but the warm vocals make the ears feel at home warm yet out in the cold and in a state of astral view. the song gives you an overlook at life and how these jobs are killing you on the inside. if any song on the album sums up ok computers meaning its no surprises. the changes in guitar and the openness at the 2 minute mark make it feel as if you are out of the world. literally. the next track is lucky. a fairly rated song in it is own right a joy to play on the piano though. a fairly slow opening rushes you into the long held notes of pull me out a reward for the ears. the song feels as if its hand-in-hand with let down both brilliant songs in their own right. the instrumentals turn from the opening of mgmts kids to a beautiful flower show of noises cushioning the notes that thom echoes from his mouth. the guitar sounds as if it boomerangs round the ears and this is ultimately a great way to nearly round off the album. we have made it. the tourist. the most underrated radiohead song and it is a shame. the song captivates you and puts you in a trance and the instrumentals are absolutely gorgeous. in a way to end ok computer this is perfection. it puts the cherry on top and ends the album the way everyone wanted it a slow bittersweet hollow beautiful rosy track which sums up all the vibrant tones of ok computer from lucky to electioneering. the song name feels as if you are arriving back home from a day of listening to the album and hearing what thom has to say about the world around us. 1010. this album is regarded as one of the best of all time and its clear to see why. the best radiohead album with kid a and in rainbows following. i love exit music.,1
i mean cmon. it is fucking ok computer. in music every once in a while there will come an artist or album that completely and totally masters the idea of melody and what makes a good one. the beatles absolutely did it in the 60s bowie in the 70s and now radiohead here in the late 90s and early 2000s. i would give you an example from the 80s but to be honest that decade never really had an all killer artist that released several ground-breaking albums in on decade. with this album you get what the power melancholy can do in music and while i think kid a is just as good if not better in some places this album is certainly more of the epitome of alternative rock while the latter nails experimental rock. i love this album and something tells me this website does as well...,1
pros good execution also pretty well-executed for sure an album cons score 10,1
qui yorke si supera e porta la sperimentazione al livello successivo prendendo spunto dal verso dei lamantini nel periodo dellaccoppiamento,1
it is honestly safe to say that radiohead are the modern pink floyd. it is not even a hot take at this point it is just a straightup fact. ok computer is breathtaking not only in its instrumentation but also in it is message and statement. just like the wall being made at a time of intense historical significance with the cold war ok computer was synthesised at the dawn of the internet. i find it so funny the thing i am using to praise this album is the exact thing that the band is criticizing in those unbelievable 53 minutes. personally i have only listened to this album once. it was in the basement of my old house while i was playing gta. classy i know. but honestly i remember it because as mentioned by so so many rym users this album sticks. the opening notes of no surprises. the fucking beastly drop of exit music. the refrain of karma police. the weird robotic voice interspersed throughout the album. i could go into every single detail of this album and when i relisten i most definitely will. but i am too fucking depressed right now to sit in thom yorkes sorrowful playground for more than 5 minutes. but i can say this much this shit has had and with no doubt will have a pivotal impact on me in the future. absolute 55 an essential album,1
the best piece of music i have ever listened to. has two of my favourite tracks of all time paranoid android and karma police. perfect melancholy. went through a sad phase and had this album to comfort me haha. the only fault i would have with this album is that it does not promote a healthy attitude in regards to living life but that is not its purpose it is not a self help tape.,1
pretty good introduction for a budding music lover nostalgia is definitely a factor nowadays but nostalgia aside it still holds up. forward-thinking changing of the times stuff karma police exit music and lucky are definitely the highlights here,1
few albums have ever affected me enough for me to write an essay on the internet about them. i would not say this album is very experimental as some people like to say it is but the core songs as in the melodies and grooves written for this album are so ear grabbing. its kind of shocking how radiohead released their biggest album after releasing easily their blandest album in my opinion yes even more blander than pablo honey. while pablo honey was the sound of a band in its childhood playing around with raw energy the bends sounded like a desperate need to prove yourself. it has teenage angst and lack of direction written all over it. ok computer was a much more mature listen with the themes that are tackled in the album. themes that would become much more relevant in the millennium to come such as our relationship with technology airbag paranoid android lucky no surprises depression subterranean homesick alien let down and politics electioneering no surprises. not only the themes of the album predict the future but also its sound. let us talk about the sound of this album. this album strikes a perfect balance between realism and futurism. this album is trying to push rock forward into the new millennium. and thus the guitars are full of effects and the production is more more detailed. make no mistake this album does not sound futuristic in a way that is corny. the band does not drown itself in glitchy tacked on alien-y effects. its not a sci-fi soap opera. its hard to describe it but the album sounds futuristic in a very subtle way without ever being over the top. even with songs like airbag the end of paranoid android and fitter happier the electronics still feel grounded. the human feel is still there. my favorite song on the album is airbag. airbag is a song that feels grandiose. its melodies sound arabic and godly. this is fitting because this is a song about the high that one feels when one is reborn. you feel like a god whenever you survive a disastrous situation. as a suicide survivor i find this song eerily empowering. my life has started again so i better do something about it and it just so happens that he does do something about it. thom yorke and the rest of radiohead made probably the most critically acclaimed rock album of the 90s. in a way he did save the universe. the contrast of technology having the power to kill us and also it having the power to save us is an interesting irony explored. the car almost killed thom but the airbag saved his life. this relationship between humans and technology is explored on other songs the way this record explores technology in the rapidly developing world that the late 90s was is interesting. this is because the band does not come off as a bunch boomers trying to say technology  bad let us go back to the old ways. after all thom yorke describes himself as a man who moves forward as he did on electioneering. so this album is more of a loose concept album trying to portray a character. and what is interesting about the character that is being portrayed is that the character is us. we are the person that is trying to deal with catching up on a rapidly developing world. as the world keeps progressing we sorta feel left out in it. maybe that is why this albums themes are still so prevalent. everyday that passes is another step towards the future whether we like it or not and that is a universal theme. on the tourist thom screams slow down as the album nears its end. maybe the character feels like the world is moving too fast for them and they cannot keep up anymore but there is nothing they can do about it. this feeling is called alienation. on songs such as no surprises the character completely rejects the modern world and chooses to live a more farmer life outside the city. this is clear on lyrics such as a handshake of carbon monoxide. this feeling of being left behind by a rapidly developing world is a because for depression. no matter how much the world progresses you will still be stuck in your 9-5 job trying to pay rent for a house that is not yours. this repetition of the work cycle can lead to becoming bored. you lose passion and interest in life and begin to indulge in fantasies. in subterranean homesick alien thom sings about wanting to get captured by aliens while he is driving. you are so bored with your life that you would like something anything even if its bad to happen to you so that at least your life has some sort of meaning to it. boredom is the main theme of let down. this is an interesting contrast to the first song on the album where our character is full of life following a car accident. i could talk about this album and the meaning of each individual song forever but i am going to wrap this up. this is one of the greatest listening experiences i have ever had in my life and i would recommend this to everyone. i do feel like the album gets too overhyped as this experimental grandiose art piece. there is much more weirder music out there. the tunes are so solid that i think anyone that is willing to give this record a chance can take something from it.,1
really beautiful writing production and lyrics. this album is strong in every way.,1
an inarguable impactful masterpiece. classic while i personally prefer the electronic and idm aspects and sounds in kid a in combination with alt rock i engage with the sounds and style of ok computer significantly. it is not my favourite radiohead album alt rock or art rock album or album full stop but there is no denying its influence enjoyability and greatness. great story great soundscape mood atmosphere and tone. essential listen. score 810 track scores airbag - 910 paranoid android - 810 subterranean homesick alien - 710 exit music for a film - 9.510 let down - 910 karma police - 9.510 fitter happier interlude - 910 electioneering - 910 climbing up the walls - 810 no surprises - 710 lucky - 710 the tourist - 710,1
there is nothing that cannot be said about this record that has not already been said. with the bizarre instrumental and thom yorkes intriguing vocals this record catches interest from the first track and does not let it go until the end. ok computer revolutionized rock music and turned it on its head and has clearly influenced everything that came after it. with the electronic influences and intriguing concept this record excels and maintaining interest and intrigue throughout its hour long runtime. radioheads magnum opus that changed rock music forever.,1
will it ever be possible to state as a fact and without any doubt that this is the greatest album of all time? i do not think so. there are way too many parameters to consider when claiming it and there are way too many musical bodies of work to state it as a fact in any way. finally emotions and tastes play too big a role in music appreciation and judging to all agree on one definitive album. but no matter if it is the best or if we can ever even find a best album ever giving this masterpiece anything less than a 5 would be a disservice to music ratings reviews critics as a whole and a disrespect to the indescribable genius that stands at the foundation of this arguably flawless album.,1
an amazing album a ton of great unique songs with extremely creative songwriting. when i first started visiting this site and noticed that this album was the number 1 highest rated release i was very dissapointed to see it above many releases i loved. i did not care for this album at all so i gave it a 0.5 star review. since then starting with paranoid android this album has slowly but steadilly grown on me i now really love it. sigh thom yorke you win. best tracks -airbag -paranoid android -exit music -karma police -no suprises,1
i mean this is the highest-rated album on the site i do not think i really need to say much here. an incredibly consistent set of tracks. not their best but it is a great pick for it. great variety of ideas and sounds all of them executed excellently. a true masterpiece. key tracks subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down climbing up the walls no surprises lucky rating 8.75,1
one of the best critically acclaimed albums ever so i figured it was time to check out this album. let me start by saying that it is literally the perfect length which is rare . i would love to write and talk about this album but i do not think i can say anything more than over a thousand people who have posted their reviews here. so in short this is an album that i listened to with all my heart and soul that put me in a state of anxiety depression euphoria and melancholy. in conclusion i can say with a clear conscience yes this album is a masterpiece although it is not a 1010 album,1
ok. i have never listened to radiohead before in my life except creep so this was my introduction to the one of the most critically acclaimed music acts of all time. and i can say that i am not disappointed. ok computer is definetely an emotionally charged and daring album. many great and personal moments throughout the album and it is those moments that makes this album an enjoyable experience. having said that though i do not feel like this is a 100 or a 95 for me it had the potential but something did not feel right. that may be because i am not experienced in the genre so i most definetely come back to this album a few months later. for now i am giving it a 90 highlights paranoid android amazing song karma police climbing up the walls lowlights subterranean homesick alien,1
esse disco chegou pra mim por obra do acaso them um momento de crise existencial. e logo de cara eu adorei no sei se pelo fato de casar com o meu humor ou se por haver uma certa facilidade de escutar as msicas to calmas e melanclicas que chegam a ter um tom de conforto. me apetece bastante lbuns que tm uma ambientao linear quase como se tivesse sido criada uma atmosfera temtica onde o lbum flui e soa como uma nica msica obviamente bem variada mas sem perder o foco imposto nessa atmosfera temtica. com todos esses elementos postos a mesa  impossvel que eu no considere esse lbum como um dos melhores que eu j escutei confesso que foi uma surpresa agradvel descobrir que a imagem que eu tinha de radiohead era um tanto quanto equivocada nesse lbum a banda se mostra bem competente tecnicamente fazendo muito bem o bsico e incluindo alguns elementos novos de maneira pontual e precisa dando um toque de pink floyd moderninho. por mais que este lbum seja de 97 s them 2021 eu tive a curiosidade de escut-lo estimulado por um amigo que me recomendou e devo confessar que de longe essa foi uma das minhas mais doces descobertas deste ano. pontos altos do disco airbag subterranean homesick alien exit music clibing up the walls e the tourist.,1
so this is what the 1 album sounds like? i mean there are most definitely worse records to put on the throne i guess. i know i am starting off negatively but this album is really solid. every track here is really excellent and the replay value is pretty good too. every song is something that basically demands you return to it. but i cannot join the hordes of people who give it a 5.0. i honestly hesitate to keep it at 4.5 but we will give it time. it is not that it is bad because it is truly brilliant for the most part paranoid android comes to mind first and foremost. it is just... boring at times. which i know it is probably a punishable crime to say that on this site but i have to be honest here. i do not know maybe it got overhyped considering it is literally the highest rated lp on the whole site. i just expected something a little more engaging. i found myself zoning out at different points across the 53 minutes and i am not sure if that is radioheads fault or my own. adhd? as of right now this sits just under the bends and leagues ahead of pablo honey. great great stuff that i will be listening to for a while but definitely overrated.,1
this album is so sad ....... and yet it makes me so happy whenever i listen to it.,1
ok computer brimming with genuine emotion beautiful and complex imagery and music and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing.,1
radiohead at the best and peak in their career. this album is unique and mixing rock and indie music. the lyrics are amazing and thom yorke is writing from his soul about change the future and being lonely. fav tracks subterranean homesick alien karma police climbing up the walls and no suprises,1
low 4.55.0 two records into radioheads prestigious discography i understand now what all the hype is about. i would not say i think ok computer is necessarily deserving of the 1 spot it currently holds but i loved the album and genuinely think that radiohead is a talented band not only as players but also as songwriters. ok computer is a melancholic nostalgic and cohesive record which washes over the listener demanding to be absorbed. its dynamism and dark lingering undertones make each song a unique piece to the larger picture the end result being a quality album. maybe not the greatest rock album of all time but it is definitely deserving of its praise.,1
airbag - 5 paranoid android - 5 subterranean homesick alien - 4.5 exit music for a film - 5 let down - 4.5 karma police - 5 fitter happier - 4 electioneering - 3 climbing up the walls - 5 no surprises - 3 lucky - 4 the tourist - 4 overall score 86.66100 - great! additional notes while the first half of this album certainly outclasses the second half in terms of quality and songwriting that does not overlook the fact that the album is tied beautifully together as a whole. furthermore although my praise for this album may not be on par with the rave reviews that it has received both in the past as well as retrospectively i can see why it is put in such high regard. one of its strongest aspects is indisputably the concept - that being alienation as a consequence of society becoming more dependent on technology as time progresses causing deterioration amongst humans in areas such as spontaneity and social well-being. as a matter of fact ok computer executes the concept so accurately that it feels as if not more relevant today than it did 25 years ago. additionally when you consider our current situation with covid-19 and the lockdowns that followed it is rather stunning how perfectly this album conveys the emotional intensity of isolation. on that note it is safe to say that technology will progressively overtake and seize further control of our lives but humans will always remain humans.,1
introduction radiohead is quite possibly the greatest alt-rock group to ever exist. not only did their albums age very well but the production on their albums have remained very complex and precise. this album specifically discusses the now-common topic the disadvantages of technology. and it does a good job at pointing out ironies of technology itself. the album fuses progressive rock and electronic rock to create a very unique side of alternative rock. radiohead already established themselves through the massively successful single creep. ironically the record companies thought that ok computer would be commercial suicide for the band but it happened to be the opposite. review the album ok computer has lyrics that have aged very well. okc is one of the most ambitious records provided by the band. the winterchristmas type production on airbag already sets in a rhythmicspooky mood for the listener. the song points out an irony. the song is about thoms car accident and how an airbag saved his life. pretty ironic how technology can kill us and save us at the same time. radiohead follows up the album with a more post-progressive rock song titled paranoid android. the vocals are very laid back and soothing which could be compared to spelllings recent record the turning wheel. yorkes lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a los angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. in particular yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilt a drink on her. i love the acoustic guitar in the background syncing in with the bass and the electronicsynthesized guitar. in subterranean homesick alien thom speaks of being isolated or different from the rest of his brethren. he wishes an alien colony can take him away just so he could be a silent observer instead of an active participant in this unfair game we call life. the concept is pretty relatable given the current status of our worldthe global pandemic just bringing in a whole new unintended interpretation to the song. the winter type experimental production continues with the drums fusing in with synthesized bass guitars. the vocals are pretty much similar throughout the entire record possibly the only repeated aspect of the album. after watching a movie radiohead was very inspired to work on the track. the result was exit music for a film a chillingly gentle song that bursts into a haunting crescendo of emotion. appropriately the track was used as a closing credit to the film they watched. i love the little alienated harmonisation created by the synthesizers and the amazing background drums. the next track on the album continues the pattern of electronicprogressive rock fusion. the song structure features multi-layered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano with unconventional time signatures and a spector-esque wall of sound. i love the gibberish vocals halfway through the track. well not really gibberish but pretty undisputed vocal ranges were used which came off as a good aspect. karma police possibly the greatest hit from the album had a laid back piano recursion. the drums are a tad bit generic and the track mixing is pretty generic too compared to the rest of the albumvery experimental album it falls short in terms of originality. karma police is a haunting and atmospheric track. thom yorkes strained lackadaisical vocals are at once warm and sinister echoing the delusions of an addict in the midst of a narcotic meltdown. musically the band follows a creamy dreamlike chord progression that makes use of an old beatles melody laid out on the piano to create a velvety bed of uneasy comfort. fitter happier is a track predicting the future of technological exploitation. fitter happier is a list of bullet points that diagnosed society for what it was and where it was headed at the time of this songs release and arguably the world we live in now. the synthesized piano chords create such a horrifying atmosphere. i honestly got scared when listening to this song considering the very unexpected vocal frequencies and the dark turn on the instruments. electioneering is a more upbeat green day type song. the song made me nod my head for four minutes straight. i love the hard usage of the electric guitar and the drum snares. one of the most replayed tracks from the album in my opinion. sung from the perspective of paranoid fear itself climbing up the walls takes the english idiomatic expression for utter unpleasant feelings such as worry and doubt giving the expression a voice. i would define this song as scary just like the band did. the hard-hitting drum productions supported by birds chirping create a very good opening atmosphere then the track is followed up with eerieambient sounds. i love how the production vocal samples and instruments are all connected with each other. no surprises seems to talk about the initial burnout an artist faces while making music. the song uses a slowed down xylophone with peaceful yet generic drum notes. the song is way more tolerable for a newer radiohead fan maybe this is the reason why this track is the last single from the album. reflecting on the first track lucky compliments airbag as thom finds himself in a position where he is yet to discuss his deepest fear long-distance travelling. the choir type chorus is so damn peaceful and soothing. i love the instruments on this song too. the 12th and the final track on the album the tourist ends off with a peaceful essence. punctuating the album with soaring guitar solos and ethereal vocals. the track is about enjoying life when a tourist visits a place he usually feels like he has to do a lot to take in the sights making him move at a fast pace hence thom telling him to slow down. track by track review airbag 1010 paranoid android 1010 subterranean homesick alien 910 exit musicfor a film 1010 let down 910 karma police 1010 fitter happier 710 electioneering 1010

experimental and still get a shit ton of sales. the album is so staggering that i could not find anything other than the repeated boring vocals throughout the album to criticize. a revolutionary record for rock. up there with pink floyds wish you were here and the beatles abbey road.,1
come on. ok computer is one of the most highly regarded albums out there and you are sitting here reading reviews on rym? give the album a listen and decide for yourself.,1
ok computer is one of the few albums i would describe as nearly impossible to review. it is the type of album you will either walk away from loving or absolutely despising. you are reading a review of an album that is many peoples number 1 album of all time nothing said here matters. all i can say is give it a listen and decide for yourself.,1
it lived up to the hype to say the least. and i think this is quite accessible for any newcomers who want to start getting into more music a record like this can be an eye-opener in terms of what music can do.,1
it was a great decision for radiohead to move away from the grunge style they were known for on pablo honey. the oversaturation of generic grunge bands caused the genre to quickly die out few years later. by expanding their horizons radiohead was able to define themselves as more than just the guys who made creep. thom yorkes melancholic vocal performances are absolutely unmatched. the instrumentation on here fantastic. lyrical themes of alienation corruption disassociation and consumerism are constantly mentioned. the production overall creates a haunting and depressing mood to the album. with each day that this album ages it is predictions are becoming increasingly accurate. people are becoming more and more alienated from one other. finding a sense of purpose becomes harder and harder under this economic system. everyone indulges so much in technology and has become dependant on it. 910 - highly recommend to everyone,1
ok so first things first. conceptually this album should be a 1010 for me. radiohead? check. moody artrock? check. lyrics about bleak modern society? check. i know that this is the intended effect but if this album had a colour it would be grey. it has a very cohesive narrative that runs through most of the tracks but it also is really fatiguing listening to this album in one sitting. the highs of this album are in orbit though. paranoid android takes the moody depressing sound of this album and blows them out of the water with a screeching guitar solo. eventually coming to a climax of a heavy guitar riff distorted screams and synthesisers out of the ass. awesome. karma police is a classic. the entire production on this song is truly amazing. if you scrub from the beginning to the middle to the end of this song they sound like different tracks yet the entire song feels complete and congruent. fitter happier is very very good. powerful and scarily accurate poetry that seems more relevant by the day. no surprises is one of my favourite songs ever. the gentle guitar riff thoms voice the overall musical arrangement and the lyrical content is so perfect to me. the message of this song is that by a certain age we are expected to just fall into the mould that society has cast for us. get a decent job a nice partner buy a house have 2.5 kids. no alarms no surprises. this really hits hard for modern society now this bleak way of life is the goal. we are expected to go into tens of thousands worth of debt to get a decent job we are more lonely than ever house prices are rising at a unprecedented rate fertility rates are declining. this boring depressing way of life is now the goal. i am not much of a contrarian but i really do not think this album is perfect. the highs are high and the lows are boring as all hell. the 53 minute runtime feels at least twice as long. however it is really damn close. i really really like this album but i hate that i do not love it.,1
ok computer rating 810 oknotok rating 910 overall rating 810 oknotok is a great return to the ok computer era b-sides and sounds and its participation or connection with the main tracklist does not necessarily make the experience bigger than it actually is yet somehow they feel just right in place and useful for the record as a whole.,1
there are some absolutely incredible tracks on this album although i believe many of the songs on the second half are hardly comparable in quality with the exception of no surprises. regardless this is an essential listen for anybody trying to get into music.,1
most rock fans will say this is one of the greatest albums of all time i am no different. ok computer is one of those musical experiences that everyone should experience at least once in their life. this album has some of my favourite songs of all time electioneering no surprises let down. i cannot see this band ever topping this album but they are definitely welcomed to try. best songs no surprises electioneering let down airbag exit music for a film paranoid andriod karma police subterranean homesick alien worst songs climbing up the walls,1
after rigorous touring promoting their sophomore album lead singer of radiohead thom yorke felt both inspired by the travel yet unsettled with the way he saw the world advancing. but everyone already knows that. i cannot open my review that way! i think to myself as i press down on the backspace key. between cultural impact and emotional resonance ok computer is one of the greatest albums of all time and it will not be forgotten anytime soon. well that is just obvious. i critique as i once again backpedal. after gaining momentum from the bends radiohead kicked things further into gear with ok computer experimenting with sounds to create the perfect- ugh. i tap delete. let us face it. it is impossible to review an album like ok computer as there is essentially nothing i repeat nothing you can say that people will want to hear. especially not from some random guy on a music database. so i will briefly say what it means to me. it is one of the few albums i can safely credit as my gateway into music at large which has become a life-changing passion. these songs hold a special place in my heart and each one for completely different reasons much like how the band wrote them inspired by diversity and change.,1
a great album from start to sinish not a single song drags and i actually liked an interlude for once. fitter happier fiuts very well after one of the most techno songs on the album karma police plays and makes the album feel very whole,1
one could only imagine a painfully frostbite winter chipping away at dead-carcass robots when they listen to this record. or perhaps a calm storm something you watch off in the far distance as the winds gust grade by grade. doom awaits. but what does not heed are thom yorkes faraway alien vocals that ring throughout the rotting loudspeakers. all you have for yourself is your wits... kind of. a dystopian concept deep fried in a freezer for the night guitars and drums as salt and pepper and what comes out is a bittersweet icicle. ironically consumerism gnawed viciously on it is roots and tore apart it is circuits. and now here it sits at the everlasting number one spot on rym. the concept itself would earn ok computer a 5.05.0 for me. but this record really did not faze me. in theory do albums owe me a broken jaw when i listen to them? not really. but for a release so highly praised it earns itself numero uno i anticipated something much more. and that hunger is what killed my rating for this album. a shame really... listening through i juggled between an extremely high rating based on if i generalized how great it is versus a moderate rating based on my personal feelings on the album. i went with my wits. i would be lying if i were to suck off this album in a review. generally speaking radioheads prized pig is an achingly bravo album. the concept is tightly strung around each song and does not falter a minute. the thematic genre of a dramatic siberian ballad holds true from airbag to the tourist. the nippy guitars color the dead dancefloor with an arctic aptitude. yet i am dissatisfied. the filler of most of these songs kill that curiosity i had coming into this album. let down climbing up the walls lucky and the tourist were all tracks i dismissed even on my fifth listen. they clogged up the main powerhouse songs paranoid android exit music for a film karma police and airbag. obviously i have a strong bias towards the more heavy soul-crushing rock-ditties. and for an album whose purpose is to defrost onto the floor as ok computer is the slower songs should be the ones i favor the most. exit music for a film has a dreamstate climax but the beginning is so barren i forget what is happening until the unforgettable summit. no surprises is excruciatingly mediocre and paired with some of the weakest songs on the album it certainly makes me want to avoid it more. i really want to love this album. i adore the overall sound each track screeches and i can only beg for it to continue on. yet every time i listen to this album my worries are reaffirmed. the execution of the later songs is what kills the kid. the topdog brainchild of thom yorke should have pulled more out of me for being the mascot of this website. there is so much that could be explored yet yorke set camp out in the worst setting. and the album starts off so strong...,1
zora neale hurston famously said happiness is nothing but a everyday living seen through a veil. while working on ok computer thom yorke said we could really fall back on just doing another miserable morbid and negative record lyrically but i do not really want to at all. and i am deliberately just writing down all the positive things that i hear or see. i am not able to put them into music yet and i do not want to just force it. yorke really aspired to make a beautiful record. but if you have heard any of radioheads music you would know that he was not a very positive person. that is where the uniqueness of this album lies. thom someone who lived life without a veil had to try to find the beauty in our world. a lot of people would say that this album is depressing or hopeless but it is really not at least not entirely. airbag celebrates the preciousness of existence. subterranean homesick alien poetically encapsulates our want to sometimes escape from day-to-day life. exit music for a film shows just how powerful love can be albeit in a somewhat alarming way and no surprises appeals to our hope for a peaceful death. of course there is songs like climbing up the walls not saying these songs are unsuitable for okc but this album as a whole always leaves me feeling reassured. it is a reminder that we are not alone in how we feel and for someone like me that is occasionally necessary. that coupled with these sounds i am just so familiarized with makes this album a blanket of comfort. the amount of emotion effort and luck that goes into making an album went into creating each song on here. like fine wine ok computer is an album that gets better with age. as time passes this albumll have more memories to evoke in me and more wounds to heal... i look forward to that with every listen.,1
ok computer is a masterpiece. is it overrated? for sure. is it the best album of the 90s? of course not! is it even the best album in the top 10 on this site? ...probably. ok computer gets a lot of shit and a whole lotta praise. it is not radioheads best record and it probably takes 2nd behind hail to the thief. so with such a negative start to this review what does this album get right? well...everything! thoms vocals are perfect as is the groups songwriting. the instrumentals break out of the rock-heavy style found on the bends not knocking the bends love that record and brings the group into more of an art-rock territory while they still maintain plenty of originality and creativity. the culmination of the bands work flourishes in two particular songs more than the rest no surprises and airbag. airbag opens the album and it shows a clear difference from the ending of the bends street spirit fade out. this one has a rock spirit but you can tell the band is not brooding as much they are not as angry as they are on the bends. this shows vulnerability. the band keeps the vulnerability going with no surprises which is easily a top 5 song all-time for me. this song is so fucking heartbreaking. it hurts me when i listen to it and i would call it radioheads best track if they had not made my favorite song a wolf at the door.. the real winner on this song is the culmination of thom yorkes vocals over top of the dreamy spacey instrumental. the best example of what i am talking about is when thom enters the final section of the song. in the wonderful music video you see his head burst out of water gasping for air and after the instrumental break this is exactly how the song makes me feel. something about the way thom sings the line such a pretty house and such a pretty girl makes me fucking cry i mean it. it is soul-crushingly beautiful. and this is reflective of the rest of the album. there are so many emotional highs and lows that this is one of the most complete album experiences you can ever really listen to. while it might not be my favorite of all time or the 90s or of radioheads discography you can bet your bottom dollar that i will keep returning to ok computer until the day i breathe my final breaths. and that is a fact jack.,1
this is one of my favorite albums ever at this point in my life. i relisten often and with each completion new meaning is given to yorkes deep lyrics displayed with amazing vocals i might add and the stories behind them. there are so many tracks on this album i love that i find it hard to rank them but i think my favorites are paranoid android no surprises lucky and the tourist. the concepts and ideas from this album still hold up to this day 24 years later and i think that just goes to show how perfect it is- and how it deserves a high spot in my heart for all of its late-night ponders about the twisted dark sicknesses with the world that i will never understand without a doubt. i love this album. it will never fail to disappoint me even when i am disappointed with everything. late at night while i am driving take me on board of their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it i would tell all my friends shit is catchy.,1

i am going to keep this brief. ok computer is the backdrop to something like 1984. exit music for a film the tourist and airbag all represent a dystopian utopia that the protagonist dreams to escape from. while paranoid android and climbing up the walls push radiohead further forward as rock legends in how outlandishly bold they represented themselves. calm down people. just because it is not pink floyd or yes does not mean it is not a modern masterpiece that will stand the test of time along with the best of them.,1
i do not know if i can properly describe how much i love this album. everything in it just works so well--from the raw opening riff of airbag to the final ding of the triangle at the end of the tourist.,1
everything has already been said about ok computer to the point where it is clich to even talk about how everything has already been said about it. yeah it is one of the best albums ever made. yeah the feelings of angst melancholy fear and solitude that it evokes are absolutely soul-stirring and flawlessly composed in dreamy immersive and anxiety-inducing soundscapes yeah it is so intricately structured and made from a place of genuine passion and heartbreak that it lends itself to analysis like the artsiest of artsy films endlessly mesmerizing and magnificently enigmatic and if you like music you are probably going to obsess about this album for the rest of your life. i am not the one to tell you all that though right...? favorite tracks wet thom yorke least favorite track the tourist 1010,1
ok computer is a masterpiece . there is no doubt that this album is a masterpiece from airbag to the tourist every song captures the dystopian future which was first conceptualised .the melancholic instrumentals and vocals are a bitter sweet symphony which further enforces its message of the severe loss of connection in society at the time of its release. the best songs which are featured in this album in my opinion are electioneering paranoid android and climbing up the walls. these songs capture the rawer and harsher sides to radioheads discography which i feel is lost through later releases. overall this is an amazing album however i believe it is only a starting point to the discography as i believe their sound becomes further perfected in later albums. this album is really a classic from the 90s and a brilliant way to get into radioheads discography.,1
i first discovered radiohead back in 6th grade and right when i heard this album i knew i was in for an album i would never forget. every song on here is amazingly written arranged produced and mixed to perfection. this album touches on so many aspects of the upbringing of the digital age perfectly and really shows how technology can either make us or break us at any moment and it has not aged a bit. i cannot even explain how good this record is.,1
bone-chillingly beautiful.,1
an inspired release which rightly wins many plaudits. the sound of this album was is! quite unique and you have to admire the originality of the music on show. i still prefer the bends as radioheads best ever long player and some of the tracks herein are a little bland hence i cannot really support this album being right up there in the all time top ten of albums ever released. but fair enough it is a classic and i am sure an album that i will continue to re-visit. key track karma police,1
radiohead is radiohead if you live under a rock or in an obscure non-western country you may not have heard of them. they are a british rock band and they have invaded the airwaves of more countries than the british empire. this album is great but i am more of a bends person myself. exit music karma police and no surprises are lovely songs.,1

this album has been with me for a long time since i was 89 years old i listened to my older cousins listening to ok computer in the early 2000s at that time being a child i did not really understand the music and the feeling that it is behind it but as i grew up and reached my pre-teens i listened to it again and it started to be part of my day listening to ok computer as i was about 1213 years old i did not understand the lyrics because not having enough knowledge in english but today listening again i can understand the concept of this album and seeing the impact it had on my musical taste making me open doors to a broader taste i just have to thank and notice the how much impacted me personally. all tracks manage to bring together all the feeling of their latest and upcoming records in a single album loneliness control sadness anguish anger paranoia all compiled with a theme that haunted the 2000s technology the internet fear of machines controlling everything of big corporations spying on you all that feeling of fear that most people who knew about computers and their next steps to change humanity are here portrayed in a futuristic fictional and melancholy way.,1
what else can be said about radioheads groundbreaking and widely beloved 3rd studio album ok computer. one of the most largely celebrated albums and considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time. it has gotten to a point where you cannot be in online music circles without any mention of this album. you can say what you want about an album of this magnitude but i genuinely believe despite the hype it is anything but overrated. overrated seems to be a term launched at any album someone does not like that happens to be loved by a large audience despite actually considering its significance and the subjectivity of music. radioheads ok computer is as important to rock music as anything that came before or after and is a significant moment in their discography. coming off of albums like pablo honey and the bends no one could have seen this one coming just around the corner. ok computer dives into vivid imagery of an almost dystopian and technology ridden society through multiple breathtakingly gorgeous tracks. songs like paranoid android with its multiple phases and let down with its just utterly eargasmic conclusion remain some of the most mind-blowing i have ever heard. the power of this album does not stop there as every track absolutely delivers to me and from front to back it does not waste your time. the tourist may as well be the greatest album closer ever in my opinion and feels like i am floating on a cold blue sea spiraling out of control. this album has been discussed to death from a musical standpoint and i feel as though there is more to say for my personal experiences with this work of art. i am absolutely serious when i say that my music taste and the way i see music would not be the same if it were not for this album right here. this album showed me that music can be emotionally powerful and can be meaningful to you as an individual. once this album fully clicked for me my life had forever changed. i vividly recall sitting in my room hearing the end of let down and realizing this album was something special realizing that this band was something special. ok computer was one of the main albums to get me through this past summer and has since stuck with me. radiohead have a near flawless discography in my opinion and remain my favorite band of all time but ok computer to me has something special. as highly praised as ok computer is it deserves every damn ounce of praise it gets not one moment on this album would i dare to change and is a true astounding feat for radiohead. the album that changed my life.,1
i do not need birth control because unfortunately this album is an absolute masterpiece. there are no flaws. the percussion? immaculate. i cannot believe i am praising this album right now but. yeah the song structures are so varied. like i said. free birth control ig,1
24 years later it still stands out. the production in this album still kicks ass even compared to todays standards. the dystopian feel is so overwhelming that it sounds like coming straight from somewhere between 2040s. i cannot really decide if this shits overrated or not. maybe both. mopey nerdcore proto-hypster only nailed it once. sacredly.,1
now let us see paul allens rateyourmusic account,1
ut. we have yet to discuss the greatest part of this song. of course i am referring to the chorus. holy shit is it good. there is the beautiful mellotron that adds wonder and excitement. there is thoms desperate howling vocals. there is jonnys magnificent guitar solo. oh and do not forget the way thoms vocals return from the heavens after the solos conclude! i could never describe the beauty of this chorus no matter how hard i try so i will just leave it here. overall the tourist is the perfect closer for ok computer. as the final chorus concludes the song calms down into simple bass and drums. these are soon cut off however by a single soft triangle leaving you to think about the masterpiece you just listened to. 55 conclusion and that is ok computer. an all-around masterpiece on every single level. before i end this review however i would like to discuss a couple of parts of it i have not gotten into yet. to start this album sounds nothing like traditional rock. while it is not as far off as later records like kid a and in rainbows there is still a lot separating it from pablo honey and the bends. you see while there are plenty of guitars on this album they are used in a much more unique way than just epic shredding. this can be seen through how let downs bubbly arpeggios exit music for a films sombre acoustics and luckys sparse sound are all completely different from other 90s rock songs like smells like teen spirit and wonderwall despite them all using similar instruments. because of this ok computer becomes a dynamic and exciting listening experience that stands apart from other hit albums of the time. despite this there are still some pretty heavy and traditional parts specifically on airbag paranoid android and electioneering. however their ideas and messages are developed enough for them to still stand out from many other alt-rock songs. and that brings me to my next point. the themes have aged like fine wine. as implied by the title ok computer is about the paranoia and fear the future can bring. examples of this can be seen through airbags distrust of vehicles paranoid androids themes of mental illness and electioneerings political slander. now these ideas are still relevant even 25 years later. this is seen through how because of the increased prevalence of technology wariness of machinery unhealthy disorders and corruption have become more and more frequent. and what do you know all of these correspond to the tracks i mentioned above! while i would not necessarily say ok computer predicted the 21st century for its ideas were still relevant back then it is interesting how well they have aged over several decades. finally the flow of the tracklisting is one of the best on any radiohead album. ok computer starts off with two of its most accessible and rock-oriented tracks hooking in those who may be unfamiliar with radioheads more abstract work. it then gets a bit more mellow with subterranean homesick alien before dazzling listeners with one of the best three-track progressions on any album. after a brief interlude to reinforce its themes of anti-consumerism and fear it then goes into electioneering which is reminiscent of the aggressive sound the album began with. with listeners now prepared for more eerie and sparse textures it then gives it to them with the remaining tracks. and that is not even taking into consideration the lyrics of each song. now the smooth and elegant flow of this record helps satisfy and ease listeners despite its uncommercial nature. this makes it much easier for them to get into the album dramatically increasing their enjoyment. as a result the flow of ok computer is an important part of it making its excellent track-listing the cherry on top of this masterpiece. and that is everything i have to say about ok computer. i know this is the number one album on rate your music. i know radiohead are one of the most memed on bands in the world. however after everything i have just written this may just be my favourite album of all time. i am still praying to god that i find a better record to make this not the case though,1
about the albums lyrical themes and composition have it hailed as the way ahead of its time predictive of societys obsession with technology and the isolation and paranoia that comes with it. yorke however explained that it stemmed mostly from his personal experiences traveling non-stop in a touring band. the paranoia i felt at the time was much more related to how people related to each other. but i was using the terminology of technology to express it. everything i was writing was actually a way of trying to reconnect with other human beings when you are always in transit. that is what i had to write about because that is what was going on which in itself instilled a kind of loneliness and disconnection.,1
this is regarded as one of the best albums of all time and it is not hard to see why. its themes are more present in our society today than they ever where when the album was released. thom yorks vocals are chilling and beautiful all at the same time and the guitars and synths all work together incredibly well for the duration of the album with a very futuristic feel to the whole record. none the tracks feel out of place but they all sound unique. my only gripe would be electioneering falls short from the quality of the rest of the tracks. high points - paranoid android no suprises airbag low point - electioneering,1
is it the best album ever? no. no such thing exists. however this is very very very good. the first 6 tracks are all exceptional - especially let down and karma police. no surprises and lucky carry what would have been a more uninteresting second half.,1
i love this album. amazing song topics and great writing. i love the instrumentation. the flow of this album is great. i get so much vivid imagery from it this album is incredible! 1010,1
this lefts me speechless from beginning to end. even higlighting how forward-thinking it is in terms of its concept and themes feels like still saying very little about its greatness. without a doubt a perfect album experience and one of the most exceptional gems in music at large.,1
it is ok computer. if it is indeed overrated and overplayed then it got that way for a reason. it is seriously that good. it is really an imaginative and visceral album. it is very hard to actually sit down and talk about ok computer. it is very hard to discuss any revered or classic album because it is obscured by rhetoric on both sides. to admirers and fanatics it is the greatest album of all time. to detractors and reactionaries it is the worst album of all time. even the grey area is split on this album with some people reasoning it is overrated and a few even suggesting it is underrated. there is no consensus on this album even though it has had various accolades bestowed upon it since the day it come out. whether or not it deserves this position is of no interest to me whatsoever. i mean how about we listen to the actual music? just forget all about audience reaction and take this album to its bare essentials. what we have is an album that is at times highly enjoyable and incredibly difficult to get into. i would argue it is a more difficult album to get into than their follow-up kid a. it takes the guitar rock sound of the previous albums and pushes it to its logical conclusion. at points this album pushes beyond guitar rock incorporating elements of ambient music progressive rock not nearly to the extent as others suggest though kraut rock and even jazz. what we get is a mix of so many influences that one cannot really call ok computer an original album. however that criticism is as old as the hills. if you are going to make your music sound like your influences make sure you do it the best out of anyone else. this is what radiohead did with ok computer. that first side - i cannot exactly put it into words. the first six tracks of this twelve track album are all of the same quality are all retained and are all nothing short of fantastic. i will not go too much into track by track but considering the opening two tracks are so closely linked it is worth talking about them as if they were one. airbag opens the album and the cut-up drums at once synthetic but also containing a human quality drive the rhythms as well as the occasional bass. the atmospheric guitars intertwined - one for rhythm one for lead and another for lead though more experimental make this track a great one from the opening guitar attacks to the duel solos between greenwood and obrien. in the midst of all of this we get thom yorke. yes he is whiny at times. however whilst it annoyed me on the bends here it is perfect. i mean given the song is about being born again after a crash with a fast german car would not you be? then again this is not pity but catharsis. he is invigorated by the experience and the adrenaline he is amazed he is survived. he likens it to an interstellar burst and feels that he is come back to save the universe. this is a rather odd reaction to a car crash but the sensation the rush is all too real for the narrator to comprehend. it the same narrator throughout all of the songs? if so the hero of airbag is now a paranoid android. this song is the longest on the album but is also the busiest. it is cut into quarters essentially. the opening section contains latin american style percussion over rather unwinding minor chords on an acoustic guitar with guitars coming in and out as they please. yorkes vocals are full of anguish wanting the listener to stop the noisei am trying to get some rest. it is at times aggressive almost subtly when he reckons when i am kingyou will be first against the wall. this anger is then fully let out in the explosive second section with all guitars coming in the drums switching from a modest shuffle to an all-out alternative rock assault. there is even some 78 time signature magic and a guitar solo that is more of a freak-out than anything. moments like the third section of paranoid android are so mesmerizing and so beautiful that it is very difficult to comprehend them. i mean this slower part of ok computer repeats itself on tracks like exit music for a film or lucky or the tourist. the synths add as a choir amidst harmonizing vocal overdubs. yorkes repetition of rain down on mefrom a great height the way his voice rises and falls over the other voices- it is truly mesmerizing. the final part of this section builds up over the rather macabre additions of pigs skin yuppies networking the panicthe vomit. after a snide god loves his children yeaaah the second loud section is replayed blowing the song out of the water. sound effects are added- the sound of someone drowning screaming and random vocals- over another guitar solo before the track switches off. this first side places two great tracks together let down and karma police we will get to sub and exit later. the former track is a seldom performed yet beautifully melodic gem with vocal harmonies arpeggiated guitars and video game like keys in the middle eight. the drums are pounding almost tribal in places but the lyrics - oh my god those lyrics. at once they are miserable and monotonous but altogether incredibly beautiful. how can a chorus consisting of being crushed like a bug in the ground be so...uplifting? how on earth can this album be depressing when the music is so anthemic so life-affirming? maybe that is the message or the concept of the album that even if you want to grow wings it would be a chemical reaction anyway meaning you have to face your problems without any intervention from a higher being. at least that is how i interpret these lyrics karma police is the best track on this album. hands down. it lives and breathes ok computer. its lyrics of arresting those who talk in math...buzzes like a fridge or women with hitler hairdos are incredibly indicative of how politics - both on the left and the right - essentially focuses a lot of its time on trivial matters. the chorus over sexy sadies piano and acoustic guitar - this is what you getwhen you mess with us - is at once threatening and sweet. the verses with the stomp of the drums over said piano and guitar - the occasional backing vocals that sound so distant and far away - also have an ongoing threat to them. the second verses pleading its backtracking the narrator giving all he can but it is not enough...we are still on the payroll shows a reliance on money over his personal desires. sounds like he is going to break down right? wrong. the ending bridge of for a minute therei lost myself the shift to b minor - but still with major chords - changes the entire tone of the song. either the narrator has learnt the error of his ways or has sidestepped his feelings of guilt to still participate as a member of the karma police. the ambiguity has little time for questions for within a few bars guitar feedback enters the song. the song ends in a nightmarish fashion with the feedback unwinding exploding. oh and fitter happier and electioneering are by no means weak tracks. fitter happier is essentially the manifesto of the album. it details the views expressed within over what appears to be microsoft sam. it cuts away from images of children smiling in the backseat to flushing spiders down the plughole all over electronic noise and guitar feedback. the ending a pig in a cage on antibiotics suggests dehumanisation leading right into electioneering which is the rockiest number on here. the lyrics as overtly political as they are are very snide. take the mention of voodoo economics or the inclusion of i trust i can rely on your vote. the chorus too over the trio of guitars of when i go forwardsyou go backwardsand somewhere we will meet shows at once an honesty of the distance between politicians and the public and a sarcastic solution or optimism over the whole thing. it is alienation. speaking of alienation is a major theme of this album. why else would the protagonist of subterranean homesick alien want to live up above where aliens hover? why else would he wish that they would swoop down to take him on board their beautiful ship? he feels alienated by his peers who never believe me who would be shut away yet feels alrighti am just uptight. the music that accompanies the narrative acts out the fantasy - space rock pitch-shifted guitars twinkling keyboards and rather plodding drums. the chorus seems to explode this fantasy to reveal his insecurities of the world around him the world that is not the one he wants. it continues on no surprises a bitter ode to the ideal life so to speak. the ironic use of twinkling xylophone against arpeggios and acoustic guitar over lyrics which profess to wanting to end life via a handshake of carbon monoxide. the narrator is tired of drama he wants no alarms and no surprises but previously expressed a desire to bring down the government losing his heart. maybe the job that slowly kills has slowly killed him too. the lyrics are also distressing- my final fitmy final bellyache- and at once hopeful such a pretty houseand such a pretty garden. over the final chorus backing vocals sing get me out of here. this life of peace is not for him. he feels like he had no choice. what other choice do the protagonists on exit music have? they must leave before all hell breaks loose and must travel in the cold singing songs to keep us warm. the sombre first verse a simple acoustic guitar then turns into a bridge section with a keyboard. the second verse has a weird effect on it that sounds like a city street before the drums come in. suddenly distorted bass dominates the mix over reverb and delay heavy tremolo-picked guitars. yorkes tale takes a new turn you can laugha spineless laugh. is this towards his lover or his detractors? either way the hope that your rules and wisdom choke you is dark. it is a darkness on par with unknown pleasures. the ending ends the same as romeo and juliet we are onein everlasting peace. in their death their dying wish is we hope that you choke before the song dies down. you can tell radiohead like pixies because loud-quiet-loud dynamics are everywhere on this album. paranoid android exit music to name a few. however climbing up the walls is the noisiest and creepiest song on the album. this one really is scary not contrived scary or theatrical fear. this is genuine terror. the distorted vocals softly sung over industrial drums and distorted bass sing about being the key in the lock in your housethat keeps your toys in the basement. it is all paranoia to the nth degree being a reflection or being everywhere you turn...open up your skulli will be there. the second verse drumming wise transfers onto the ride cymbal adding flourishes of a crescendo. strings appear in the choruses but are more prominent in the second chorus. electric guitar can be heard too and the lyrics become more obscure to understand - fifteen skulls to the back of your head i have got the smell of a local manwho is got the loneliest feeling - before a massive interlude over an echoey clarinet ? solo. when thom comes back to sing the song title a few more times dissonant strings join him over a final scream. the songs insect noises and strings die down. lucky is also fond of this sort of structure. starting with obrien playing on the nut of his guitar yorke enters over the ride cymbal with i am on a rollthis timei feel my luck could change. his guitar is scratchy and the bass is full of motion. the scenes of a plane crash unfold over lead guitar - his wish for sarah to kill him again with love have been met - as he is pulled out of the air crash...of the lakecoz i am your superhero. the instruments back out save for yorke and his guitar intoning we are standing on the edge. the addition of choir like keyboards on the second verse creates a rather heavenly feel over thoms refusal to listen to the head of state. he repeats that it is going to be a glorious day almost sarcastically but something tells me the protagonist takes the air crash as a source of pride. the outro which again builds things up gradually adding guitars the music becoming more aggressive before a closing repetition of the chorus and we are standing on the edge. the song segways into the album closer the tourist and it is a great album closer because it gives the listener a chance to slow down after what has happened thus far. the rather jazzy calm instrumentation over peter green style albatross slide guitars contrast with the lyrics of more alienation being singled out by a dog that barks at no-one else but melike it is seen a ghost. so is the narrator literally a tourist or a tourist going into the afterlife? the heavenly synths in the chorus of hey man slow downidiot slow down seems to suggest both. the mentions of sparks or a thousand feet per second seems to reckon back to album opener airbag. in fact the chorus could be an exclamation inviting either the narrator himself or the other driver to slow down. the closing guitar solo uplifts the song before all dies down except for a little triangle ping. theories exist that the last two tracks of ok computer link back to airbag and then the album goes around in circles. i support this theory. ok computer is one of my favourite albums of all time. it encompasses a range of styles and influences creates thought-provoking lyrics and showcases a knack for writing pop songs within a more complicated framework. i do not care what poll it is on whether it be among the greatest albums of all time or the most overrated albums of all time. i personally enjoy it and i find something new with every listen. stay fit and happy and whatever you do turn it all the way up.,1
radiohead who did not succeed with their first studio album pablo honey in 1993 but signaled that they will be one of the biggest rock bands of the future with the bends in 1995 and ok computer in 1997 made songs that sometimes translate our feelings in our personal space and remind us that we live in a society. according to most critics radiohaed is one of the greatest rock bands ever with thom yorkes excellent songwriting and vocals jonny greenwoods unique guitar ed obriens back vocals and guitars that create an incredible atmosphere in songs and phil selways harmony in the band. and again according to many critics the best album of this rock band is ok computer. maybe even the best album ever made. the most important factors in the writing of this album are the environment created by modernism and the enslavement of people one of the most fundamental results of neoliberalism at the end of the 20th century. written with a kind of post-modernist movement this album mostly depicts the crisis people experience from the mouth of a real person or from a third point of view. there is a passive rebellion against the role of the individual in society and the system that carries out this role in the first-person song. in the songs told with a divine perspective the relationship between individual and society is examined. thom yorke did not use clear language while writing these songs so the songs make us think. the album is also a perfect album musically. the album contains many elements from experimental parts in some tracks to pieces that guitars are not used extensively like no surprises. in this way emotion transformations are very intense within the album and the album is musically fluent. for example many critics think that paranoid android contains 3 separate songs. in addition different environments created in some intermediate transitions add a different flavor to the album. for example the song subterranean homesick alien which tells the story of a man who forgets the meaning of life can take you into space in an instant and make you watch the world from a spaceship as promised in the song. sometimes you listen to songs on the album that push you to face your personal feelings. and while you listen to these songs sometimes you get hopeful sometimes you admit that there is no exit from the current situation and you are helplessly silent. sometimes the narrator suggests that you should do the behavior that the system ideally shows you. of course this narrative is made with a critical point of view. in the song the narrators voice represents a sort of industrial world. this album which includes excitement fear despair sadness and rebellion in general was written as a post-modernist rebellion to the industrial world by the end of the 20th century. this album is a masterpiece that claims to be the greatest album ever both musically and in terms of lyrics. and it is perhaps the most important thing that brought radiohead to where it is now. this album also has a very important place for me emotionally and it is my favorite album. thank you so much to radiohead for presenting this album to us ...,1
i liked it a lot but no best album ever made is a bit of a stretch. i think i prefer wish you were here or court even. but i can definetly see the appeal. its like a modern beatlesfloyd album without too much of the prog elements or pshycadelic rock that the beatles were famous for. its got its own thing and you got to respect that even though for me its not my favorite. a lot of songs are ballads with heavy music which for me made the album a little stretched basically the songs were simply taking up run time. it also did not help that i had to search up genius and youtube videos on what the album was about lol thanks middle 8 but no i did not think the album is a 10 or anything more like a 7.510,1
i say this alot ok computer is the best album created by man. a bit if an over praise honestly but i mean it. a friend of mine once said ok computer is the best album to ever exist period. it deserves to be put in a time capsule and launched into space before humans ruin the planet and it is lost forever a statement that i completely agree on. it may make you feel suicidal or it may make you feel free. for me this album is so important because of what i think of when i listen. when i listen to this album i feel like i do not have a care in the world. i sit back and become one with the masterpiece. thoughts of dying do not come to me. i think of how lucky i am to exist at the same time of such a great album. i want to dance in the rain dramatically close myself away disappear completely but still live to see another day tommrrow where i might go to a family function or i might play games with friends. but when the time comes again i will be back to where i belong my place the quiet place of my own sanctuary. i hate to talk like i am some experienced old person but i am frankly upset that most of my generation does not see radiohead as an elite band with depressing lyrics that hit the soul. but i am also upset that i do. you see this conversation is unrelated to radiohead so i will spare you that. you see i have not really made an effort to show me peers this album. which does not give me much of a right to complain about people not knowing it. maybe if i make an effort to enlighten others things can be good. anyways that is the rundown of ok computer written by a 14 year old girl that grew up too fast.,1
ok computer is just one of those albums you can completely understand its position on this list. when thinking about absolute musical perfection which is a rarity this is one of the albums that first come to mind with such amazing instrumentation and vocals as well as a captivating concept and the unnatural prediction it gave for the modern world its quite easy to see why this is one of the greatest albums ever solidifying radiohead as one of the greats.,1
la mayoria de las personas no saben ni entienden lo que es necesario para grabar un disco clasico no es solo tener buenas canciones se trata de la cohesin que se mantiene entre los tracks definitivamente ok computer es uno de los grandes logros del a humanidad. un disco que habla precisamente de la humanidad en tiempos tecnologicos otras grandes obras como blade runner ya haban hablado de esto pero no fue hasta ok computer que pudimos tener un registro auditivo sobre este tema. grabar un disco como ok computer es un trabajo inmenso que por lo que he leido llevo al colapso a radiohead y no es para menos. no puedes grabar algo como ok computer sin dejarte la vida en el cada pieza del disco es perfeccin pura incluso fittier happier que seguramente influencio obras como fight club. no me cabe en la cabeza como pudieron grabar este disco y es lo que hace a las grandes obras tenemos en el top 10 de rym discos de pink floyd loveless de mbv y a los beatles un buen disco no es solo las canciones es la grabacion el concepto el desempeo la visin de los artistas y definitivamente ok computer es uno de los grandes discos de nuestro tiempo.,1
the first time i heard a radiohead song i was still a kid browsing throgh the tv somehow i ended up watching the paranoid android clip and it was just stuck with me i could not take my head anywhere else the animation was so beautiful and strange to me. specially the axe scene. some years later i found what it was all about and this year i listened carefully to all the songs i can say for sure that this is one of the best albums out there.,1
thom yorkes shining moment as a vocalist for his entire career is here on climbing up the walls where after a whole bunch of build-up leading into the final chorus he just fucking screams his lungs out in a final piece of catharsis. those 3 seconds may be the most impactful any radiohead song has ever been. the albums p good too even if the second half is a bunch of good songs that drag because they all sound like album-ending tracks.,1
ok computer is the third studio album released by english alternative rock band radiohead. the album was released on 21st may 1997 by parlophone records and capitol records depending on the region. the album was produced by radiohead along with now long time collaborator nigel godrich who would go on to produce every other radiohead album since ok computer. the album was recorded over the 8 month period of july 1996 - march 1997 with the exception of the track lucky which was recorded on 4th september 1995. the album was recorded mainly in st. catherines court near bath in somerset and clocks in at 53 minutes and 21 seconds. in september of 1995 radiohead were commissioned to take part in the help album a charity album from war child in support of victims mainly of the ongoing war in bosnia which would end in december of that year with the death toll standing at around 100000. the song the radiohead contributed was lucky which would later find its way onto ok computer. finding themselves tired after extensive touring for the bends the band decided to take a break in january 1996 returning to the studio to demo tracks for their next album. after a few months in the studio radiohead headed out on a 13 show long tour in america. on this tour radiohead were asked by director baz luhrmann to contribute a song to the soundtrack of his upcoming adaptation of william shakespeares classic romantic tragedy romeo and juliet. thom yorke told humo magazine that when we saw the scene where claire danes juliet holds the colt. 45 to against her head we started working on the song immediately. the song they created was the aptly titled exit music for a film which plays over the films end credits. the song was kept off of the films soundtrack but would as with lucky find its way onto ok computer. the band started recording the album proper in july 1996 mainly at st. catherines court in somerset. the bend were not contempt with just continuing the commercial sound of pablo honey and the bends with ed obrien telling q magazine in 2003 that everyone said you will sell six or seven million copies if you bring out the bends pt.2 and we are like we will kick against that and do the opposite. the albums music was inspired by artists like miles davis elvis costello  r.e.m. with lyrics inspired by the political writings of anarcho-syndicalist  libetarian socialist noam chomsky among other things. thom told melody maker on this album the outside world became all there was i am just taking polaroids of things moving too fast. some recurring themes of the album are technology modern life  the future. the title of the album comes from the 1978 radio adaptation of hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which the band listened to on their 1996 american tour. thom said the title refers to embracing the future it refers to being terrified of the future our future of everyone elses other considered titles were ones and zeroes  your home is at risk if you do not keep up payments. the albums artwork was done by thom credited as white chocolate farm and seasoned radiohead collaborator stanley donwood. the artwork shares the same apocalyptic feel as the album a result of donwood trying to make something the colour of bleached bone. the first track on the album is airbag a song inspired by a car accident thom got in in the 80s with his life being saved by an airbag. this theme had already been visited by radiohead on their 1995 high and dry  planet telex b-side killer cars which spoilers is a better song. unfortunately radiohead decided to open up ok computer with the weakest track. not that it is bad or anything. just not to the degree of quality of the rest of the record. the song is however a success at setting the atmosphere for the record with the introduction of the idea of the danger of new scary technology like cars i guess. the song also refrences reincarnation with the lyric an airbag saved my life coming from a magazine article thom read. 810. next up is the inequitable classic paranoid android. thom wrote the lyrics after an unpleasant night in a bar in los angeles where he saw a woman react violently to having a drink spilt on her imagery that is replicated in the songs music video. he is quoted as saying that paranoid android is about the dullest fucking people on earth. the great title serves as the albums second reference to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy coming from the character marvin the paranoid android. the track provides a great example of thoms trademark falsetto vocals. structurally the track is comparable to queens bohemian rhapsody starting relatively slow and light before moving into a sonic youth sounding guitar rock sound and then moving into the angelic bridge. speaking of i really like the bridge. it showcases some of thoms best lyricism creating a vivid image of an apocalyptic hellscape unfolding before your eyes. 910. track 3 is subterranean homesick alien a song about a narrator who wishes to be abducted by aliens in order to escape his dull life. the track was inspired by an assignment thom received while still at school where he had to write martian poetry. with a title that references the 1965 bob dylan song subterranean homesick blues the track features brilliant reverb guitar and drum rolls that well represent the feeling of alienation as well as giving the track a fitting empty space like feel. i particularly enjoy the use of a pause in the line they shut me away but i am alright. 910. track 4 is exit music for a film which does in fact serve as the exit music to a film with that film being baz luhrmans 1996 shakespeare adaptation romeo  juliet. the song itself takes inspiration from the classic tragedy with thom telling select in july 1997 i saw the zefferelli version when i was 13 and i cried my eyes out because i could not understand why the morning after they shagged they did not just run away. it is a song for two people who should just run away before all the bad stuff starts. the track features atmospheric guitar paired with an almost unsettling closeness with the vocals. the choral vocals that are brought in as the chorus starts give a warm apocalyptic feel an atmosphere that is furthered in verse 2 with the inclusion of unintelligible sounds in the background. the song then bursts out with the addition of drums then heavily distorted guitar and then bass before once again fading away with thom giving out some frail sounding we hope that you chokes. 1010. next up is track 5 let down a song that to me at least has always sounded like a love song. apparently according to thom about that thing you get when you are in transit but you are not in control of it which i guess makes sense. that quote now that i think about it just reminds me of the bit in father ted where a smiling father kevin is sitting on the bus and the driver puts on the radio and lo and behold an acoustic version of exit music for a film starts playing causing father kevin to rapidly fall into a depressive state. great stuff. shame one of the creators is a massive transphobe though. anyway back to radiohead. the song on the surface seems more straightforward than the previous tracks but as with most radiohead songs nothing is as simple as it seems. jonnys guitar is playing at a different time signature to everyone elses instruments helping to create a phil spector-esque wall of sound. one line that particularly stands out as summarises thoms attitude to himself and life throughout the record is hysterical and useless. 910. track 6 is karma police a pleading song about the idea that you will never be happy in a capitalist society under your boss thumb. the title and lyrics come from an inside joke from the bends tour. jonny said in an interview in may 1997 whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way we would say the karma police will catch up with you sooner or later. the heavy drums and bass hit create a dark rhythm that gives you the feeling of being dragged away by the police. the line about the hitler hairdo still catches me off guard even after listening to it so many times. i like the piano in the chorus that pairs well with some almost bowie-esque vocals from thom. 910. fitter. happier. track 7. thom yorke told melody maker that fitter happier is the most upsetting thing that i have ever written. i cannot say i completely agree but it is definitely up there. fitter happier creates a vivid image of a desolate sterile society where everyone is fitter happier. the track features chilling haunting piano paired with vocals done by fred one of the synthesised voices from the macintosh application simple text. furthering this feel is the use of musique concrte with audio from the 1975 political thriller three days of the condor. i always used to skip this song but it has since become one of my favourites. 1010. next up is track 8 electioneering probably the most overtly political track on the album being inspired by the poll tax riots of 310390 as well as noam chomskys analysis of contemporary mass media under the propaganda model from his 1988 book manufacturing consent. i suppose i should probably explain the poll tax riots. the poll tax or to give it its formal name the community charge was introduced by margaret thatcher in scotland in 1989 and in england and wales in 1990. the poll tax placed a single flat-rate per-capita tax on every adult in a household. this ended up harming those who were less well-off i wonder if the tories knew that was going to happen eh? leading to the riots of 31st march 1990 which led to 339 arrests. the poll tax was abolished in 1991 and was replaced by the council tax in 1993. onto the song it stands out on the album as having a heavier noise rock sound with great drumming that creates the feeling of a riot. thom described the track as a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones. 910. track 9 is called climbing up the walls and features lyrics about thoms time as an orderly in a psychiatric ward hospital. it was also inspired by krzysztof pendereckis modern classical composition threnody to the victims of hiroshima which just to add an additional fun fact is sampled in the heavenly version of manic street preachers track you love us. the song provides a chilling piece like the audio version of a horror movie aided by thoms vocals which remain in his high register throughout the track. the strings also kind of make it sound like a bond theme. i think the reviewer from select magazine puts it better than i ever could thoms voice dissolving in a fearful blood-clotted scream as jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo. 910. next up is no surprises and i am just going to cut the bullshit and say as of today as i write this at 1028pm on thursday 10th december 2020 that this is my favourite radiohead song. the way the guitar just cuts through the atmosphere the overall sound the lyrics. perfect. all that and it was somehow recorded in one take. apparently radiohead strove to replicate louis armstrongs 1967 classic what a wonderful world which is a job well done in my mind though a more overtly desolate version. the song also replicates as thom put it a fucked-up nursery rhyme. no surprises runs parallel in my mind to the song this is yesterday by manic street preachers from their 1994 magnum opus the holy bible. both tracks have a downtrodden yet somehow upbeat sounds as well as similar lyrical themes see such a pretty house and such a pretty garden from no surprises and houses as ruins and gardens as weeds from this is yesterday. beautiful song. 1010. track 11 is lucky which had previously been released on the 1995 help! compilation from war child. the song is inspired by the ongoing in 1995 it had ended by 1997 bosnian war which was an extremely brutal conflict with horrendous war crimes being committed mainly by the yugoslavia supported serbia. the majority of proceeds from the help! compilation going to those affected by the bosnian war. when you remove this context the songs lyrics sound ominous and almost evil. lyrics like kill me sarah i feel my luck could change it is going to be a glorious day really exemplify this feeling. 910. next up is track 12 the tourist a song about tourists thom saw rushing around france. jonny was the main writer of the songs music drawing inspiration from the same place thom did for the lyrics. this track feels like a closing track even from its start which was one of jonnys main aims. the song has really nice guitar peaceful to start but begins to build up. it kind of feels like you are being shot into space. 910. final score 92100 capitol records considered the album to be commercial suicide but nevertheless along with parlophone launched a large marketing campaign which included -print advertisements -adverts in tube stations in london -t-shirts -an fm radio in the shape of a computer very clever boys -a floppy disk with radiohead screensaver how cutting edge -1000 cassette players with promo tapes of the album stuck in these marketing efforts proved successful as the album debuted at 1 in the uk and 21 in the us. the album sold 136000 copies in the uk in its first week going on to become the best selling album of 1997 in the uk. ok computer has sold 7.8 million copies to date making it radioheads best selling album. the against demons tour began in barcelona on 220597. the band went across the uk ireland continental europe north america japan  oceania. the tour concluded on 180498 in new york. thom told mojo in august 2003 that was a year too long. i was the first person to tire of it then six months later everyone in the band was saying it. then six months after that nobody was talking anymore. ok computer received universal acclaim from critics and was nominated for album of the year at the 1998 grammys but lost to time out of mind by bob dylan. it won the grammy for best alternative album. it was also nominated for best british album at the 1998 brit awards and was shortlisted for a mercury prize. thom said of the albums reception in 2007 what really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create. the album is preserved in the national recording registry of the library of congress as of 2014.,1
the bends was for most people the record that defined the sound of radiohead a blend of a deeply emotional pre-sadcore structure and intense and aggressive post-grunge. the album was both a commercial but critical success which gave the band the chance to do absolutely anything. recorded alone in a haunted mansion ok computer was a enormous change in sound and ideas. leaving traditional song structures the band experiments with more free and complex structures reminiscent of the old prog-rock eras. the little bleeps of effects from the bends become huge walls of sound with clear but very well used post-rock and shoegaze influences. radioheads openers are always other-worldly painting the first impressions of the atmosphere and sounds to come in the record. airbag is a cluster of intensity and alienation under airy guitars and a mix of organic and machine drums. it is energetic yet melancholic with a slightly odd atmosphere and is probably the most dense track on the album and definitely a notable piece from their discography. after four beeps at the end the complex prog-rock ish guitar-driven insanity of paranoid android is a slap on the face being probably their longest song almost 7 minutes it is divided in 3 parts and they are all very various but very completive too the connection both musically and thematically of those truly proves a step forward in maturity for the band. without any transition subterranean homesick alien a heavily reverberated and other-worldly song incorporates some of the more jazzy harmonies and weird filters in favor of an exceptional emotional intensity. exit music for a film calms down the previous tracks agitation with a quiet dark and haunting song. the structure and tension it creates is a breath-taking and incredibly powerful in its climax. it is a cathartic experience and recalls the crescendo structure from of the post-rock genre. let down uses multiple layers of guitar to create an unique wall of sound of complex harmonies and rhythms. the progression in this track leads to a huge and intense climax. the song is what would be the foundation of later pieces from the band. in the second half of the album electioneering is the most straightforward guitar-driven track here. the absolute craziness of the bends added with accusing political lyrics just works very well with the record. climbing up the wallss distortion and aggressive effects climb to complete insanity the summit is rough incredibly wide with notably the string section inspired by pendereckis atonal writing. this track is horrifying and extremely memorable. in no surprises the band calms down everything with an oddly desesperated lullaby probably one of their prettier song sonically yet quite dark lyrically. lucky and the tourist close the album beautifully with a breath-taking emotional intensity. these tracks are unbelievably smooth and colorful. it is then obvious that the album has a very clear message to pass ok computer attacks that pre-internet world with a fear of a world overwhelmed by technology and continuous information. the reason why each songs are so different is that each of the tracks describe a particular character of society. the interlude track fitter happier shows that very explicitly a computer-controlled artificial voice tells what seems to be advices but quickly becoming paranoid and terrifying. every song in there are very unique and almost perfect in their own way from the despair of exit music for a film to the terrifying agony of climbing up the walls or the emotional intensity of the tourist. overall the result is satisfying and seems meaningful. --- ok computer is one of those perfect albums that never ceases to amaze me in how great the production musicianship and songwriting in this are. not only being flawless this record is quite inpactful in its meaning and is a big twist from the bends really pushing forward guitar music as what post-rock or shoegaze did but here with an exceptional musicality. masterpiece. from my instagram page kiddae,1
i definitely get why ok computer is objectively the greatest album of all-time 1 on rym. i think vocally this is radioheads best album. tracks like airbag paranoid android and the tourist exemplify that best. from a lyrical perspective this album is frightening because most of us agree with what the album is saying. it shows themes of the future of technology paranoia and isolation. there are a great selection of singles on here that were not shy on the charts. paranoid android might be my favorite song on here as the song transitions from a more calm to aggressive periods. it eventually leads up to a very melancholic part of the song where the humming and vocals are soothing. let down sounds like it heavily influenced the 2000s alt-rock scene. i do like the song but do not think it is as great as people make it up to be. karma police samples a beatles song sexy sadie and makes great use of the sample. it is probably the most accessible song on the album and an amazing tune. i would say that i think there is a roadblock in ok computer. that would be electioneering which is usually agreed as the lowest quality song on ok computer and climbing up the walls which is probably my least favorite song if i had to pick one. i do think that both songs are still great though. the album ends beautifully with the tourist. the song has an amazing vocal performance beautiful hook nice guitarwork and a great sense of finality for the roller coaster of emotions you just went through.,1
amazing album but it is not the best album ever made. in fact i prefer kid a or in rainbows.,1
two days ago i decided to click on a video about this album it talked about how the band went from an afterthought of the grunge era to becoming one of the most critically acclaimed bands of all time. i was really interested and decided to listen to the album the next day yesterday so that i could listen to it properly and hear the story that this album tells. the album tells a story of a world overrun by automation and business and people struggling to catch up with technology the whole album is based off of these ideas. the songs tell of different things happening to the human race like in paranoid android where everyone becomes more animalistic and less like people or climbing up the walls being about the growing paranoia in the population. there is one thing about this album that kind of makes it difficult to get and that is the vocals i seem to get lost on them and i found myself having to look some of the lyrics up to fully understand them. that is all. overall this album is a pretty good and accessible post-rock album that i could see myself listening to every once in a while. it is abstract it is bleak and it is emotional.,1
radioheads ok computer is a tightly packed beautiful and extremely influential record that changed the worlds idea of what music could sound like. i do not have a lot to add that has not already been said thom york is a great vocalist the compositions here are insanely well done and chock full of different musical passages and progressions its themes are consistent and interesting. everything here combines into a near - perfect experience. this album has some of my favorite radiohead songs still paranoid androids multiple musical ideas make for a consistenly ear catching and engaging listen and exit music for a film is as dramatic and alluring as it is title implies. i do feel like the very cold tone of the record can put some people off the moody  gritty sound of the record does not make for any great party music or anything but it fits the album very well and is absolutely lovely if you are able to get past it is pretty dark and intense exterior electioneering falls into the trap of being too cold and uninteresting to be enjoyable for me honestly. the angry and speedy sound is great but it never goes anywhere interesting with it. fitter happier is a off - putting track at first glance but after looking through the lyrics and ideas of the record the impersonal sterile robotic speaking  unsettling atmosphere make complete sense and is one of the most mind - opening song on the whole record. after multiple decades of being out ok computer is still an awesome listen and it is ability to engage with the listener and get them to experience its themes and stories unfold as each song builds on the one previous is almost unmatched to this day. number rating 9  10 fave tracks airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police fitter happier climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist least fave tracks electioneering,1
perhaps this is the most influential album since the dsotm in the world of music and undoubtedly marks a watershed in terms of alternative rock although a bit loaded with the depressive and melancholy the songs it has in this sense are excellent karma police no surprises lucky the tourist and subterranean homesick alien and yet that also has moments of great intensity in songs like the epic paranoid android or the incredible airbag and  or climbing up the walls simply a wonderful job and which to date remains an unquestionable benchmark.,1
what an amazing experience radiohead was allways on my mind but they really got on my to lisen list when i started going to this site and saw this as the best album of all time so i was really surprised but i knew this band would not make me fell the same things as the beatles or queen so this album would have to be really really good so that i would love to lisen to this a lot of times it was close the album is great but as the descriptors says it all anxious pessimistic depressive are not my style and rarelly get the 5 starswith rare exceptionsbut this album is that a bit because of the lyrics and i dont consentrate much on that the album has amazing sorrene quitar work and instrumentasion in general and some great roching tracks and some hins of pink floyd in lucky my favorite track is subterranean homesick alien with its calm atmosphere and i love thoughfullnes of the album is such a mind jouney and fitter happier what a song what a piece! so interresting the piano work the hole aura and the spine chilling robot voice and some ways this track reminds me of revolution 9 from the beatles and they compare a lot radiohead and the beatles now i get it i am really interrested in this band fantastic album not number 1 not my favorite,1
after toasterqueen12 finally pushed me to listen to an actually good piece of music for once i have now listened to ok computer. ok computer is a pretty solid release that shines for me in it is second half but i see really growing on me with multiple listens. when i started the first track the whole thing was pretty sudden to me. i have never listened to any alt rock projects really and if i have they probably were not good but this one just hit me like a bus. i was like do i like this is this going to click with me. and at karma police it sure as hell did. the production on that song is crazy and thom yorkes vocals work well over it as well. it just got better after that and i really enjoyed it. the first half was good but it did not click but that second half really did. i feel with multiple listens i will love this album more and more. i can really understand why this is considered such an influential and great piece of art. overall a very good release that will grow on me with more listens. 85100 best tracks karma police climbing up the walls no surprises lucky worst tracks airbag,1
the first time i listened to this i was partly pleased and partly underwhelmed. i had listened to kid a before this so this ended up feeling like a midpoint between the two surrounding albums i preferred. i do still consider it such but after a few listens this managed to grow on me. the first three tracks are some of radioheads finest carrying a psychedelic feel that you can properly immerse yourself in. those happen to be the best three but tracks like let down electioneering climbing up the walls and no suprises keep the listener interested. there are quite a lot of influences to the eclecticism here and it is important to note that - radiohead did not just create all these styles off the cuff. they just managed to bring them all together nicely. no need to recommend this given its popularity already and perhaps not the album but worth the time from my perspective. best song subterranean homesick alien,1
weakest songs are at the end. still a 10. this is like losing yourself in the ocean at night no shores in sight the ice cold water surrounding your whole body but most importantly doing it willingly. it is every bit as deeply pessimistic as it is absolutely beautiful.,1
ok computer has stated itself as one of the best albums of modern music and of course the best in radioheads discography. even still after more than 20 years of its release it expresses perfectly humanitys lovehate relationship with technology.,1
years ago i reviewed this and coming back to it i realize now i did not have a good understanding of this one. very impressive how they manage to be so experimental with the dark futuristic cold gloomy themes and atmosphere but make it sound so good and easy to listen to. being a hip hop head i am very accustomed to being able to pick and choose songs from albums and be able to love them on their own if they were to be shuffled on a playlist. but this album meshes so well together it gives the listener an unreal experience as a whole. i get the hype a bit more now.,1
in which radiohead reaches the natural conclusion of their 1990s evolution. this might not be the best alternative rock album ever but it contains several of the best alternative rock songs ever and its only real mistake is ending its runtime with its two weakest songs which are still absolutely excellent. one album ago they were among the bands defining the alternative sound on a really good but at times pedestrian album. two albums ago they were squirting out hot shit. it is obscenely impressive how fast and efficiently radiohead evolved. what really makes this album so great is that it is the first and maybe even the only one in which each band member has massive influence on the sound and yet even with their own separate sensibilities every single idea on this album sounds like it came from the same obscenely talented person. on pablo honey most of the music of the band was drowned out by overloud grunge guitar crunching. on some of the best parts of the bends bass drums piano and less aggressive instrumentation and production provided a glimpse into some new layers of emotion and sound radiohead were capable of. on this album there is not a track that does not contain bold and interesting drum and bass parts by phil selway and colin greenwood. there are few tracks that do not contain gorgeous piano and keyboards. most of the tracks contain elements of chris greenwoods growing interest in classical orchestration. thom yorkes songwriting has reached its peak his vocal delivery the most believable desperate howl you have ever heard. the members of the guitar trio have all found their place--this album contains mystifying effects guitar by ed obrien some of the best high-energy guitar solos i have ever heard by jonny greenwood especially on paranoid android and electioneering and incredibly evocative rhythm guitar by thom yorke. the overbearing crunch of grunge giotar production has disappeared completely leaving bear for all to see a band of six supremely talented writer-musicians firing on all cylinders and all in the exact same direction homing in on one of the best albums ever recorded like desperate deranged robots who have just discovered emotion and inspiration. there is a lot of variety on this album not a single song sounds the same except maybe let down and no surprises but they all sound like they are supposed to be together. thematically most of the songs explore burnout and the pressure of a young professionals life in the city yet i find it better not to think of this as a concept album exactly. it does not seem to be organized that way and it does not need to be. this is just an album of arternative rock perfection that happened to be made while its lyricist was feeling exhausted and using those feelings to great effect. as i mentioned the albums only flop is ending with its two weakest songs lucky and the tourist. both great songs neither have album-ending energy with lucky having a good hook but being one of the least compositionally complex and instrumentally daring runtimes and with the tourist being aetherially mellow and less thematically intriguing than any of the first 10 songs. were it not for this track listing snafu i could easily see the case for this being the best made album of all time. and what does a good band do after recording such an album? if they are truly great they do something totally different. if they are truly great and legends they do something totally different that is nonetheless on the level of an album like this one. radiohead are legends.,1
yep this is the big one. whenever radiohead come up in discussion 9 times out of 10 it leads to talking about ok computer. but does that make it the best radiohead album? short answer no. as important as this album is to me and to music generally climbing up the walls is pretty forgettable and fitter happier is sort of like an extended unnecessary interlude. though i am a fan of electioneering this three track run on the second half sort of kills the momentum of the album. that being said you cannot ignore the brilliance of this album as much as some people may want to. even on those three weaker songs the production is immaculate and still feels completely timeless yet also as though it could have only come out in 1997. that is as close as i will come to bashing ok computer. airbag paranoid android exit music for a film let down and no surprises are all perfect songs and would each be strong contenders to make a radiohead top 10 list. that is without even mentioning the criminally underrated lucky and the previously underrated by me karma police. my point is even though this is not my personal favourite radiohead album the songwriting here is the best it has ever been for the band with one of the most eerie and brooding atmospheres ever put to an album to boot. though full marks may seem generous based on my comments this album is too important to me and to music today for me to give it any less. i can look past the slight issues with pacing on the back half because this really does play like a best-of for the most part.,1
diooooooos! el disco ms poderoso de los radiohead. me gustara poder volver a escucharlo como si fuera la primera vez,1
the album that completely changed my taste in music as a freshman in hs in like 2011 i kind of became that guy that went against the grain. i had many friends although i thought rap was kind of lame and that people my age just listened to it to seem cool. i was narrow minded and as i fell in love with this album and radiohead i thought i had such good taste that was superior to others. i do not even know why i ever brought them up because my friends would just go i cannot even name a song by them who are they or oh yeah creep is dope and the conversation would go nowhere. i remember hearing exit music in a romeo and juliet movie in theater class and being like omg that is radiohead and people just being like who? after getting into hip hop my junior year when i got a car i completely switched up my taste but did not hate on bands i had formerly listened to. after i graduated college i went back to my roots and listening to this album again brought it all back. i also had a different pov and resonated with the lyrics and the feelings of isolation anxiety hopelessness acceptance etc. not a single song i do not like although exit music can vary in quality depending on my mood and of course fitter happier is what it is but i respect it in the context of the album. i am giving it a 1010 because its my favorite album of all time and my gateway into experimental music. the epitome of a timeless album.,1
i remember being really miserable at a camping site this one time and deciding to take myself on a walk along the dunes. now this was pretty unprecedented. a child and children do not voluntarily go on walks. my parents were justifiably bewildered but i had a trick up my sleeve. ok computer! at the time i did not know it was considered by many to be the greatest or one of the greatest pieces of music ever made. all i knew was the 5th track was really sad and i was a pretty miserable little fucker. so i heard ok computer in it is entirety for the first time. yeah the cracks are showing. fitter happier and electioneering back to back is not the greatest look in the world but to be frank an album with so many songs that are this entwined with me? cannot be anything less than a 10. and yeah lucky is better than about half the songs on here but i think that more speaks volumes about how many fantastic songs this band has written than anything else.,1
it is really good make no mistake. but do you ever play the sims and make an art goblin just so you can make extra money? sometimes i like to make an incredibly ugly sim with loner and virtuoso traits usually in the arts build a room in the basement with a bed a toilet a shower an easel and a fridge and remove the door so they have no option other than to spend their torturous existence producing art for other peoples consumption. it generates extra money and serves as an outlet for sadistic whims without actually harming anyone. reader do you ever do that? that is what i feel like thom yorke is but with music. a music goblin. there is no way a person who is not entombed in a doorless basement could have written exit music for a film.,1
i remember seeing radiohead videos on mtv in the mornings before school. anxiously waiting for the lyrics i want a perfect body. i want a perfect soul. to make me feel ok not being ok not being cool. than i saw the time in which true love waits would finally be studio recorded. and true love waits in haunted attics and true love lives on lollipops and crisps those lyrics reminding us of the horrific places love lingers in our minds and why it is important. why we can never become strong enough to not let love hurt us again years and years after love appears to have lost its relevance. finally learning that it cannot keep us safe from the bunkers of war but somehow that does not really matter because it exists on lollipops and crisps. like some kind of literal fairy tale. but we are not here to talk about those songs. i stole ok computer. it was my first radiohead album. i was in the fits of active addiction. a friend of many years said i could borrow it. i was homeless. i had a sony discman though. i played this record non-stop. it was terrifying. but i never gave it back. i would never get the chance to either. i did tell her i took it. she told me the album was written with me in mind. i deserved it. it was mine. the cacophonous thundering of paranoid android sounded like my brain after returning from iraq. i felt so much like that paranoid android. the karma police were coming to get me for my crimes against humanity. why i did it was hauntingly familiar in fitter happier. no surprises has a surreal effect making me ok with whatever is coming down the pipe. i would later learn that after ok computer was released radiohead went on tour and all of their equipment was stolen. everything in it is right place tuned and orchestrated to it is precise calibration. stowed cared for and untouched. none of the equipment could be easily replaced. they had to cancel the tour because everything was tuned to everything else and so difficult to match. computers synths guitars wires and robot machinery. bill gates probably could not figure it out. i suppose that is similar to my abduction of the record from abby. in this age their is a line from our hearts to our minds that can only be connected by radiohead. ok computer is only one of the albums that tells us this.,1
airbag. really nice hopeful sounding intro track. that twist at the end is nice too. maybe a bit same-y throughout the whole song but it is not that bad. 910 paranoid android. so great. so so great. starts off really mysterious and cold turns into a rock banger takes a sad bridge and ends with a banger again. fabulous. the bridge is a tad streched out though. 9.810 subterranean homesick alien. another great track. introoutro riff sounds cool and it is refreshing to hear just a fun song after the monster that is paranoid android. i like it a lot a little more than airbag too. 9.310 exit music for a film. really cold at the beginning and the end is just...seriously bone-chilling and beautiful. i wish the guitars were louder in the beginning and the ending just a bit longer because i just wanted that feeling a little more. 9.110 let down. man... this track is kind of a let down to me. it is not a bad song by any means i just do not think it is on par with the rest of the album. the melody just is not that interesting. thoms vocals get really good at the end though and the electronic boops in the middle were not bad either. 710 karma police. this is like the third sad song in a row so the intro might bore you but it is a really catchy punchy song. the chorus is haunting but pretty with the piano and the end is also really nice and catchy as you get to hear thom shout-singing. 9.210 fitter happier. really cool disturbing and cold interlude with this monotone robot voice over some creepy sounds and effects. sets an interesting atmosphere. it could be shorter though. 910 for an interlude electioneering. god i love this track so much. it is so packed with these absolute bangers of guitar riffs. it is so fun throughout. i do not even care if it sounds same-y it is just that fun. i know it is wrong but 1010 climbing on the walls. probably the creepiest song not including fitter happier. the effect on thoms voice is so cool and that instrumental bridge is fuckin nuts. his scream at the end too god damn. 9.410 no surprises. to me this is like the better version of let down. more intriguing lead melody has more cool sounds and bits throughout. it is also a nice change of pace after two straight bangers. 9.510 lucky. holy moly another banger. that guitar at the chorus is too damn good. the bridge is amazing and the final bang is fantastic too. 9.910 the tourist. pretty good for a final song. starts kind of slow for me but that ending is so mesmerizing. your brain just floats off into another dimension. 9.110 editnov 12 2021 you know what? fuck all of this. fuck all of this long review. let down is great now. i like it a lot more. the tourist is fantastic too. 1010.,1
christgaus review of sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band perfectly describes my view of this album a dozen songs good and true. perhaps they are a little too precisely performed but i cannot complain. well there is a little more to it than that. unlike sgt. pepper which has very little connecting the songs ok computer is more thematically and musically consistent expressing a very specific kind of millennial angst which has aged very well. the eclecticism feels very well-balanced never veering off into excess nor being unable to sustain the entire experience. the songs themselves? all good though the second half is a definite step down. unlike latter-day radiohead thom is actually interested in writing coherent melodies which lose a bit of their potency being delivered by his nigh-incomprehensible caterwaul some of which actually end up foregrounding themselves let down. the way i talk about this album sounds like i hate it but that is not true at all. each song has something unique to offer and though the lyricism is vague it is radiohead after all it does not slip into laziness anywhere near as much as their latter projects sometimes even being quite compelling. there is too many flaws for a higher grade but too many great songs to justify dropping the score below an 810. the best thing radiohead ever did and though it is not the only good thing it is definitely their most consistent effort overall.,1
in 1993 radiohead released pablo honey an average rockgrunge album that was not anything special. in 1995 they released the bends which was easily superior to pablo honey and a huge step up for the band. little did they know when writing ok computer the album they would release in 1997 they would change music. while the bends took the boundaries of music and stretched them ok computer just straight up disregarded them. it is the sound this album created that became a strong influence on many other artists. i felt it fitting to open up this review in a similar manner to my review on the bends because the jump from pablo honey to ok computer was unlike we had seen in almost any other band. in only 4 years they went from being that creep band that some people know about but have only heard a couple songs from at most to one of the greatest bands of all time. the first aspect of the album that should be noted is how grim and dark it is. from the very first guitar on airbag to the final ding on the tourist the album portrays alienation anxiety and dread. in some cases the instrumentals themselves are enough to sell this point. on my personal favorite track on the album climbing up the walls the dark instrumentals and anxious string arrangements all lead up to one final explosion as if the song is screaming out in horror and pain with guitars and strings and all. other tracks however follow the very radioheadish tradition of pretending to be ok or even joyful when in reality that is far from the truth. no surprises sounds pleasant with its calm and almost refreshing guitars and instrumentals but when you look at the lyrics you will see that it seems to represent giving up and in a rather depressing way too. meanwhile the interlude fitter happier involves a mechanical voice speaking over some dreary dreadful and somber piano. it describes the ideal citizen someone who is fitter happier more productive etc. whereas it seems obvious after some time that this is not how life should truly be. as ideal citizens all different copies of seemingly the same person they are living a lie. when living like that there is no way to truly be happy. subterranean homesick alien meanwhile takes a slight break from these dark and paranoid themes and instead focuses on alienation. through echoey guitars and soft drums it explains this feeling of homesickness and loneliness. the instrumentals on this album are stunning. the nervous-but-open atmosphere of the tracks is very well achieved and in a different way with each track. songs like exit music and climbing up the walls start off slow or quiet but you can tell from the get go that something is not right. over the course of the tracks they build to a climax full of energy and then fade back out quietly as if mute whispers are all that remain of them. exit music is one of the most anxious tracks whereas climbing up the walls is downright horrifying. meanwhile the masterpiece of an epic that is paranoid android has multiple different sections all packed into one song movements that flow and fit together. it also includes some of jonnys best guitar freakouts and still follows through with the paranoid atmospherethus why the songs name is extremely fitting. electioneering is more straightforward and does not really settle well with most but i quite like it. it is driven on strongly by immense energy and loud powerful guitars as well as some excellent riffs in the ending portion of the song. the distorted drums and varying guitars on airbag add a unique atmosphere to it that opens the album perfectly with electronic noises and airy guitars mixed with a heavier distorted beat paired with electric guitars. let down is another track that seems happy but is actually quite grim. it really helps to drive home the point of a false sense of security with its joyful drums and pleasant guitar a cunning mask for its truly sullen lyrics. meanwhile karma police represents how unique people who do not follow everyone else in their way of livingperhaps the way of living described in fitter happier are treated poorly and how individuality is hard to keep. the pairing of guitar and piano makes for a great aesthetic. lucky has some evident pink floyd influence and it makes for one hell of a track. the calm eerie quiet of the first verse leading into the chorus with thom belting out the lyrics as guitars scream and swell behind him is sublime and pairing the song with the tourist to close the album works perfectly. the tourist itself is an amazing song slow and quiet until the chorus explodes with energy. it is as if the song is desperately screaming for everyone to slow down. the final guitar riffs are once again perfectly fitting for the song and sound marvelous. these two songs help ok computer go out with a bang of epic proportions an ending that you cannot help but remember closing out with one final ding! while it is only my 3rd favorite radiohead album the fact that they got from pablo honey the generic rock album to ok computer an alt rock masterpiece full of unique soundscapes in just 4 years blows me away. the weaker tracks are still amazing and even the interlude does a damn-near flawless job at representing the album. i could not have asked for anything more and it still remains clear to me why some people say that it is the greatest album of all time.,1
although every decade since the 1970s has produced fewer classic records than each of its predecessors the absolute best of the 90s are on par with the masterworks of any era. in fact there appears to be a growing consensus of critical praise toward the more ambitious side of the decades alternative and indie rock movements an indian summer of creativity that exploited increased studio accessibility to temporarily cut through the overly commercialized nature of the music industry. standing at the absolute pinnacle of arty alternative rock excellence is radioheads ok computer. this is a latter-day classic that is fully deserving of all the praise even when that praise rivals the adoration bestowed upon the beatles pink floyd and company. i will not pretend that it is my all-time favorite album or that it is somehow beyond reproach but it is a seminal release that any serious music fan immediately needs to acquire. thousands of pages have already been written about ok computer and i have little to add about the records overall sound. suffice it to say that the album is filled with slow-burning alternative rock and that it manages to sound thoroughly modern despite the fact that traditional rock instrumentation is given at least as much space as synth experimentation. a perfect marriage of old and new that is unrelated to the contemporaneous post-rock movement but succeeds for many of the same reasons. i will also note that while ok computer frequently draws comparisons to the subsequent kid a it is equally easy to characterize it as a natural extension of the more deliberate tracks off the bends. ok computer is still distinctly less alternative rock sounding than its immediate predecessor meaning that listeners who are not already alternative rock fans should have better luck with the synth-dominated kid a but everybody who likes ok computer should give both of those surrounding albums an honest try. personally i would rank ok computer as one of the best sounding records in my entire collection. the sound production here is absolutely stunning and special kudos goes to producer nigel godrich and multi-instrumentalist jonny greenwood for squeezing the most out of every melody. thom yorke is also at the height of his game delivering the best collection of vocal melodies in his career. as readers of my reviews are undoubtedly aware i usually do not fixate on the lyrical content of albums but ok computer is a big exception. a perfect encapsulation of cynicism in the information age. my only significant stylistic complaint about the record is that yorke occasionally crosses the line from emotive to needlessly melodramatic. this is especially true on ballads like exit music for a film or the tourist whose operatic choruses provide plenty of ammunition for those who enjoy deriding radiohead for yorkes whiny singing. at 53-minutes the album is also 5-10 minutes longer than it really needs to be but it is remarkably restrained for its era and rarely sounds overlong while you are actually listening to it. minor criticisms for a record that does almost everything right. ok computer still would not be nearly as fantastic if it was not for a superlative collection of underlying tunes. i hear three stone-cold classics in paranoid android karma police and no surprises the first of which is arguably one of the best and most inventive alternative rock tracks of all time. the remainder of the album is filled with stellar deep cuts many of which would have qualified as standouts on any other radiohead record. however my opinions about these tracks differ slightly from the norm. i am not nearly as sour on electioneering as many hardcore fans although i will admit that it is guitar-driven melody would have sounded more at home on the bends. whether or not you love electioneering should be a good indicator of whether you will place the bends in the same league as ok computer i do. i have also never particularly warmed to either exit music for a film or the tourist. i would not classify either of those latter selections as mediocre but they are both extremely slow and i am repeatedly turned off by the aforementioned dose of melodrama. if you ignore fitter happier that means that nine out of the eleven tracks on ok computer are excellent. and that is one hell of a ratio that is only matched by a handful of records in my collection. ok computer is an obvious 5.0-star record that rivals siamese dream smashing pumpkins as my favorite release of the 90s. if you absolutely love what you hear on this album also be sure to check out the associated airbag ep which is significantly less stunning but includes six leftovers from the same studio sessions. 9.410,1
instead of straightforward themes and guitar-work typical of the early 90s on ok computer radiohead opted for abstract lyrical content and glitchy instrumentation. although i am not the biggest rock listener this is still one of my favorite albums of all time. i do not think it is 1 per say but it is one of the first albums i listened to and i definitely understand the hype. this change in direction for radiohead can be heard immediately in the first track airbag. the lack of clarity in the lyrics can be observed by reading the first lines on the album  in the next world war in a jackknifed juggernaut i am born again. these lyrics are an allusion to thom yorkes car accident and the airbag that saved his life. the glitchy instrumentation can be heard in the drum pattern throughout and the sound effects in the second half of the song. this was an amazing opener and just a very sentimental track in the radiohead discography. an aspect of radioheads music that remains unchanged from their previous records are the saddening lyrical settings and instrumentals. some moments on this album are incomparably melancholic and hopeless. among them include the emotional climax at the end of exit music for a film the third switch-up on paranoid android and the chorus of lucky. in addition fitter happier is an unusual interlude-type track near the middle of the album with a text-to-speech voice stating various daily tasks of many people in a saddening fashion accompanied by off-putting sound-effects and piano. it was an unxpected highlight depsite the lack of vocals from thom. there are tracks on this album that take a different approach to mood as well. many tracks have contrasting lyrical and instrumental moods  for example airbag no mistakes and let down. the instrumentals for the first two are both melancholic and cheerful at different parts but the lyrical content is completely hopeless. they explore themes of death suicide and pessimism respectively. subterranean homesick alien and the tourist are noteworthy because of their spacey and laid-back instrumentals. the slow and jazzy instrumentals of both compliment the lyrical themes. in the tourist the chorus of hey man slow down is meant to symbolize how some people tourists as a synecdoche here move in life too quickly. subterranean homesick aliens themes of isolation are also complimented by the slow gloomy instrumental. the guitar solos on this album are also notable. paranoid android contains a guitar solo near the middle that is chaotic and suits the tone of the song amazingly but the best solo on this album is easily the one at the end of the tourist. the high tones are very emotive and are a great way to conclude the album. although i love much of this album there remain uninteresting moments  namely the unadventurous and uninteresting instrumental of let down  that has not aged well. let down has some things to like including the touches of synth at the end but this track has always sounded like it could be in a commercial. it is a little too easy-going for my taste and i have always felt the lyrics do not portray insincerity and disappointment as well as they intend to. climbing up the wall has a cool eerie mood and nice instrumental embellishments in the last part of the track. however it is nothing special in my opinion compared to the rest of the record. electioneering is the worst track on ok computer in my opinion. although it is livelier than let down it also sounds like generic commercial music. it feels very out of place in the tracklist because of how straightforward and tireless it is. the lyrical themes on this album are relatively nuanced but there is really no layers to peel back here. overall this song is just a bore. although i am not as praiseworthy of it as most rock fans i still love ok computer. if you enjoy adventurous instrumentals abstract lyricism and want to listen to a more melancholic rock record then i recommend this album. even if you are not a fan of rock music this is a great-entry point. strong recommendation.,1
there are some albums i always forget how much i love them. then i see them with 5 stars on my ratings and i start to doubt my past-self. so i give it another listen after some long time and i am always like nope this is indeed fucking beautiful. ok computer is one of those albums. i do not think i have enough words in my vocabulary to explain what i feel when listening to it. the music radiohead was able to create within this album format this 50-minute 12-song format so replicated and so well-known by all of us goes beyond reality but also never reaches the kind of surreal habitat of imagination. it is almost a twilight zone kind of album. it is music that defies expectations but never feels off-grounded. as if the whole world existed for millions of years solely for the purpose of this album being made but also as if this is no big deal just keep walking... except now the whole ground is shattered the weight of living given a face a story a sentimentality. almost an inside out kind of shit where emotions have their own emotions. ok computer breaks jaws bleeds eternally crashes from the sky straight to the center of the earth. it leaves from the other side not more gigantic not more ridiculous but purely more human. a journey so technically flawless that only existed when fueled by delicacy attention and emotion. pure raw strong glowing emotions. an exercice of humanity reflected mirror by mirror into infinity challenging comprehension space time and rational thoughts. it just is. and there it lies the beauty of life.,1
ok computer is an artistic statement. it took the dying soul of rock music and did something completely new with it. and although i think it is in part along with kid a responsible for the massively diminished prominence of rock in the mainstream i feel it elevated the genre as an artform. ok computer forms a truly powerful and forward-thinking narrative about the state of the modern world and the looming and inevitable threat of technology as a means of division among people. the album is soaked in anxiety paranoia and isolation the themes are perfectly built in its instrumentation and thoms high-pitched lamenting vocals. paranoid android is the best radiohead song to date it is the artsy music fans bohemian rhapsody but it tells a much more powerful story with the ending segment standing out as one of the most harrowing yet beautiful moments in music. let down and exit music are two of the best vocal performances of all time they add massively to the songs impressive writing and instrumental structure turning these from great to all-time great tracks. the finale in the tourist is just so fitting with thom belting to slow down a insightful warning to a frantic and rapidly declining world. ok computer is a true masterpiece.,1
lots of things have been said about ok computer it is praised by lots of people and it is ranked as the best album of all time in rym. is it actually the best album ever? i do not claim that it is but it is a legitimate candidate for this title. this album is often compared to kid a and in rainbows when people argue what is the best radiohead album. kid a is the most innovative album out of these three in rainbows is the most diverse one and ok computer is the most consistent one. and not only that ok computer is the most consistent radiohead album it also features their best songs ever simply radiohead at their best. every song in this album is great. paranoid android delivers powerful moments with hard-rocking guitars along with touching moments as this song has a unique structure. exit music for a film gives me goose pimples at the end of the song every time i hear it partly because the first time i heard this song was in black mirror. airbag opens the album with a very optimistic vibe and is more unique and complex than any song on the bends showing the listener that ok computer is not just another simple album. another great song from this album is climbing up the walls which is the true underrated song in this album an emotional song that explodes in the end. and you cannot forget the most well-known quote from the music industry for a minute there i lost myself from karma police which is one of the best moments in this album. i can keep talking about the songs but that is not my point in this review. all of the songs are great on their own but it is their compilation that creates this masterpiece as all of the songs while being very different have a common vibe that i cannot really explain well but it is those little electronic touches in each song combined with jonny greenwoods electric guitar. this vibe integrated in each song creates the sound of ok computer. listening to this album in it is order really gets the best out of each song for example fitter happier is not a song that you will enjoy listening on its own but it feels just right in the mood between karma police and electioneering. another thing about this album is that it ages really well which is not something that you can say about a lot of albums and the more i listen to this album the more i like it this album grew on me slowly. ok computer is truly a masterpiece and an essential album for every music listener. 55,1
words cannot describe how passionate and deserving this album is to be ranked number one on the charts. the album ok computer completely took me by surprise and now is my favorite album ever. the rock aspect put on alternative music really shines with radiohead. other radiohead albums like the blends and a moon shape pool are amazing albums but this one takes the top of all other radiohead albums. the true impact this album has on alternative music is truly amazing and i hope that this album will pioneer a new stage of music in the coming years.,1
i mean...is there really anything new i can say about ok computer that has not been before in its past 1567 rym reviews? it is ok computer for heavens sake! radioheads greatest release and one of the greatest albums in music history! calling this album an easy listen is debatable depending on whether the person you are asking is a religious follower of doomer ideologies. but the themes of alienation are so unbelievably strong it is difficult to swallow at certain points. i mean i cannot go on with this review without pointing out the obvious the emptiest of feelings disappointed people clinging on to bottles and when it comes it is so so disappointing let down and hanging around crushed like a bug in the ground she will smashed juices flowing wings twitch legs are going do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel one day i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction hysterical and useless a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal you look so tired unhappy bring down the government they do not they do not speak for us i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide and no alarms and no surprises ...never mind how crazy the instrumental work and thoms bleeding vocals sound the closest to perfection any band or solo musician has ever attempted to reach. one important thing to note is that if you love this album then i urge you to listen to the oknotok 1997 2017 re-release version. you are really missing out on an equally amazing collection of b-sides and previously-unreleased songs from the bands recording sessions around ok computers original release. my goodness i promise man of war and lift are all equally gorgeous!,1
radioheads ok computer is beyond visionary and careful in its craft. from any standpoint it is safe to call it a masterpiece. it is a fully cohesive conceptual piece which on top offers a wide variety of nuances and textures for all tastes from the epicness found in paranoid android to the grunginess of electioneering. a unique and immensely replay-able album.,1
it is ok computer. there is not much that i can say that hundreds of people more eloquent than i have already said time and time again. undeniably radioheads most famous album and in my opinion an absolute masterpiece that ranks as one of the best albums of its decade. radiohead kept all of the fantastic songwriting and instrumentation from their previous album the bends mixed in a little bit more experimentation and made the overall sound darker and wow did it resonate. every song on here is fantastic with about half of them ranking in my top 200 songs of all time or so. there is an even mix of rockiness and slowness making ok computer perfectly paced and absolutely breathtaking to listen to. ok computer deserves every single bit of praise it gets.,1
i do not know why but i feel bad giving this album a high score. all the tracks have great diversity amazing melodies and absoloutely gorgeous textures which have stayed fresh after all these years so it is not like it does not deserve that score. the themes of disillusionment in society is still relevant to this day and this album is genuinely timeless. maybe it is just because it is such a popular album and i like to pretend i am cool. the only complaint i can really make is that thom yorkes diction is horrible in places but it is not that often and the instrumentation backing the vocals up are interesting enough to carry the songs. you have almost certainly listened to this but if you have not what are you putting it off for?,1
everyone says ok computer is a classic for a reason and the songs i love the most on it are not even necessarily the ones that people celebrate most often which i guess shows you just how good it is. many parts of this album do tend to be a bit pompous and rock-ist though and while all of these songs are good not all of them are necessarily that unique or exciting.,1
this review is a part of my ongoing exploration of radioheads discography so it is come to this cosmia on radiohead the album ok computer. christ. if i wrote about modern alienation and the 21st century and the human condition and thatcherism and blairism and corporations and dystopia like better writers than i have that would be a cliche. if i said something like you have read all about this album already you do not need me to go over it again that would be a cliche. if i said something like it is ok computer what else do you need to know? that would be cliche too. even if i just left the title up there without giving it a write-up it would seem a little on-the-nose. you cannot say anything new about this album. you cannot even say that you cannot say anything new about this album because a million people have already pointed that out. wait i could say that i had a weird sex dream where i was hooking up with my high school crush in buckingham palace and the ceiling was a giant poster of the ok computer cover art. i guess that is something new right? now this will not feel so much like spitting into the pacific ocean. the cover cold abstract alienated. not my favorite radiohead cover but it sets the tone and the lost child bit is nicely eerie. time for cosmias opinion right i am not going to act like my opinions unpopular. there is no opinion on ok computer that is unpopular. as annoying as it is to be read nutritional facts about its importance and ambition it is even more annoying when people act like they are in the french resistance because they think fitter happier is lame. insofar as any opinion i have is important it sure is not this one. so ok computer is an undeniably great album but it is not even close to my favorite radiohead album. i am not going to say that the riff in paranoid android does not kick ass. i am not going to say that exit music for a film does not knock my socks off with its climax. i am not going to say that let down does not remind me in its forward motion and quiet anxiety of riding the london underground. the forbidding beauty and terror of climbing up the walls the gentle resignation of no surprises the slow descent of the tourist into a single chiming bell all unimpeachable. and yet... this will probably make me sound like a stupid asshole but there is a real we live in a society vibe that i get off this album. the bends had a bit of that but for the most part it remained subtext. and while future albums leaned into the whole dystopian thing even harder they showed rather than told which i will get into more when i get to those albums. but here you can see the influence of the big statement record prog acts like pink floyd try as radiohead might to deny it and i am not sure that is what i like in my radiohead. i said most bands that sound like radiohead are influenced by the bends the exception is muse who are definitely inspired by ok computer. that is not to say that this album is not evocative! climbing up the walls is an instant paranoia-boost making even the most quotidian activity fraught with dread. no surprises encompasses the deadening tedium and the curious comfort of daily life better than any song i can think of. and while fitter happier is as subtle as a not-at-all-subtle-thing it is undeniably effective with its microsoft sam drone and the snatches of voices and piano underneath it. it really does feel dystopian but it does not feel natural. it feels less like the frightening more-dystopian-than-the-alternative reality we live in and more like a self-conscious representation of it. and that is why this album brilliant as it is does not reach the full potential of what radiohead can do. except for... best song subterranean homesick alien. i said earlier that there are no unpopular opinions when it comes to ok computer but i still felt a bit uneasy about naming this the best song on the album. exit music for a film and no surprises were close runners-up and both would be more representative of what this album sounds like. but subterranean homesick alien is the closest this album comes to my ideal version of radiohead inscrutable jazzy warm and cold at the same time. bitches brew was an influence on ok computer and you can hear it most clearly here those electric keyboards are as sunset-streaked and welcoming as the ones you would hear on a song like sanctuary. it is dreamy astral jazz-rock like floating through neon-colored mists between skyscrapers and it does not forget a great big hook uptight! uptight! hell yeah. assorted great moments the drumming on airbag thoms arcing vocal melody in the first section of paranoid android the transition from section one to section two in that song any of jonnys solos on that song the climax of exit music the dueling thoms building to transcendence in the climax of let down the piano of karma police the strings in climbing up the walls going from rich to downright penderecki-esque in their terror the chiming guitar of no surprises the bell that ends the tourist. ding!,1
ok computer 1997 by radiohead is the obvious stand-out. a big cultural touchstone of the boom times it was so huge that even a local paper was called the kensington sun just for referring to it. the mass-appeal could be seen as integral to the success of the first radiohead album ok computer. this bands name is also used to refer to a number of all-american rock bands  all of which received some major rock-star treatment when they came to american shores. johnny cash was called cash jerry lee lewis was called lee stone temple pilots was called stone and members of the national lampoon who of course currently is known as the national lampoon and has their own catalog of pix. ok computer 1997 by radiohead is one of those rare pieces of music that fans could easily dismiss as hokey guitar-plucked nonsense but it does not take long to begin to appreciate just how thoughtful and generous that sampling is. yeagerrrrrh!!!!! every track on this record  from the twinkling tinkle of making out to a graveyard dirge to the scuffing sounds of the reverse-engineered classical stylings of the title track  bursts with a carefully crafted bit of experimental instrumentation before accelerating in a heady new-wave vibe. classic nu-metal may have been a dead genre by this point but this exhilarating poppy-sounding debut is a great reminder of the genres wide appeal.,1
i have changed my mind this is definitely a really good album. karma police and electioneering are kind of weak points for me but all in all definitely a top 3 radiohead record.,1
es su mejor disco? en mi opinin si. es el mejor disco de la historia? ...no. no niego que este disco es genial tiene momentos mticos  pero a veces pienso de que exageran un poco en ponerlo como la obra maestra de los 90s o ponerlo en primer lugar en la lista de los mejores discos de todos los tiempos de esta pgina pero bueh es lo que pienso. tal vez en un futuro cambie de opinin. le doy un 8.510. temas destacables airbag paranoid android karma police let down no surprises.,1

ok computer by radiohead an album held in such wide high regard by music critics dare i say i am a bit nervous to review this album? i dare. radiohead has always been a band to me that either you get or did not get. i have always wanted to get radiohead. unfortunately for me to this point i have not been able to get it. i have given this album a half-hearted listen to back in college when i was first really trying to expand my musical horizons. i did not appreciate it but i like to think my ear has grown since then physical or otherwise and i am ready to give it another go. a better set of headphones a more focused listening style and a vehement want to like this album are ready to go. without further ado the album starts off with airbag and i have to say somehow i feel like i am already enjoying this album a lot more than i remember. i have this odd memory of it just being so bland and inoffensive but i was clearly wrong right off the bat. this song has a clean sounding grunge oxymoron i know ambiance to it from thoms slurred singing to the grimy guitar but then is transformed in the last minute with some futuristic sounding dj work. on to one of my favorite named tracks on the album paranoid android you are greeted with an acoustic intro that slowly builds on brooding vocals and teasing you a few times till you get the grandiose release around the halfway point with a stellar guitar solo that then fades quickly into hymn-like chanting but not before closing with an abrupt flashy guitar riff. this song sonically captures that essence of paranoia the mood swings the anxiousness the the longing for what is to come. this track shows the artistic prowess that yorke has made himself famous for. as an anecdote had the 2001 film a.i.s soundtrack not been composed by the legendary john williams i think this could have been a terrific slot in at some point and not just because of the name. subterranean homesick alien is the first track i really love on the project mostly because i think this reminds of the radiohead that i do already know and enjoy like high and dry from their previous album the bends. the guitar is psychedelic and futuristic and thoms vocals are the cleanest and most impassioned so far on this track list. exit music for a film is again another well named track although this time it does not seem quite so clever when you know the backstory. this is the song that plays as the credits roll in baz luhrmanns rendition of romeo  juliet. that anecdote aside i think you could slot this into any closing credits sequence and it would be a perfect fit for any drama. the somber guitars that very slowly crescendo in the end accompanied by yorkes lyrics of we hope that you choke makes for a horrifying albeit fitting arrangement. additionally i think this definitely earns a place in my personal hall of fame of fantastic post-break-up songs. the sixth track on the album is another favorite of mine karma police. this track shows how thom yorke can take what looks like simple lyrics at face value and elevate it so much more just by performance and choice of backing instrumentals. the i lost myself outro paired with the psychedelic and screeching guitar parts gives the listener their own feeling of falling down that rabbit hole. fitter happier is less of a track and more of a social commentary of how the band feels about society as a whole. although i appreciate the haunting message and the excellence of its delivery i often do not appreciate being preached to in such an on the nose kind of way as the subtlety here is about as much as a brick in the small of my back. now after that mini-rant this is going to sound awkward but electioneering an incredibly politically driven track in case the name did not give it away is definitely one of my favorite tracks on the project. but this song is also exactly what i was talking about. it may be blunt in its narrative but delivery is important and being able to pair a message with a foot stomping rock track feels a lot less agenda-ed than an ominous robotic voice reciting the bullet points of life that society expects me to live by. climbing up the walls is an eerie and haunting track that only gets more unsettling as it continues on. the strings and vocals become slowly more and more distorted until about two thirds of the way through where the track reaches its blown-out climax that only incites more anxiety. this song gave me a very bizarre and creepy visual while listening to it. it was like being sat in a hard wooden chair across from a painters easel in a dimly lit basement the only light coming from atop the stairs in classic horror movie fashion. and i just sat there as black water color paint dripped from the top to the bottom and ran off the edges but i could not move to stop it as much as i wanted to. to me this is a song that really harps on the effects of mental illness something of which that hits close to home for a lot of people including myself. i love this track almost in a sadistic way because of the sheer level of emotion that this song evokes. but as uncle ben famously said with great power comes great responsibility and i could not recommend you add this particular track to a daily listen playlist. listen to this track when you need it most when you need a catharsis for emotions you feel others would not be able to empathize with that is how powerful this track is to me. back on track to the rest of the album. no surprises is a very odd track sonically. it has these very plucky string parts and glockenspiel that emulates a very spring-like and happy emotion that is juxtaposed against some very harsh lyrics the song starts with a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal. it honestly just leaves me feeling very confused more so than anything else. the penultimate track lucky raises an eyebrow for me. now i do not know if this is intentional especially because it feels a little out of character for yorke but this feels like a power-trip of a song for thom. with a chorus of pull me out of the air crash pull me out of the lake because i am your superhero we are standing on the edge and the second verse starting with the head of state has called for me by name but i do not have time for him... it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. but i must say the track ends with a killer guitar riff that almost makes me forgive the egotistical journey we just on. the album ends on the tourist which is a sleepy sounding track through the first four minutes before transitioning into some understated guitar solos that make for a fitting conclusion to the album in just about every way. ok computer comes in at 12 songs and 53 minutes in run time which i would say is right about the sweet spot. but this album took me almost exactly double that time to listen to all the way through and do my simultaneous write up. that really speaks to the power that this album has behind it. that being said this might be my most thorough review to date and i did do some half-decent research into the project after the fact. what i am getting at is i understand why critics praise this album to the degree that they do. aside from impeccable production and arrangement that certainly speaks for itself thematically and compositionally i am not sure you can do much better this is an album that like ogres and onions has layers. and that is what i am positive so many people find attractive about this album. it is deeply relatable and progressive in its message it almost feels like if this were a movie i would immediately would have told you it was designed to be oscar bait. but this also i think further proves my point on getting radiohead. those that wish to peel back the aforementioned layers will find a treasure trove waiting for them. but for those that do not as i once was are left with an album that sounds good but is very weird and unconventional a combination that i would not have rated nearly as high as i have it rated now. i still do not think that i get radiohead but i think i am close. overall this album is beautiful. but in a way that i did not think i could ever describe an album it is exhausting. the beauty is something that is almost earned rather than presented which i suppose is part of the allure of the project. it is well worth the listen but i definitely understand if it simply is not for you. high notes subterranean homesick alien karma police electioneering honorable

i revisited this one recently and now i can pinpoint my own criticisms as to why ok computer is not my pick for the greatest album in radioheads discography. i originally saw this one as a weird sidestep album to see if they can get away from brit-pop but now i think of it as a transitional album. the first half from airbag to karma police is one of the greatest runs in music from the 1990s. even paranoid android a song that i felt was disjointedly put together from various rejected rh songs into one composition is not as jarring as i remember it being. the highlight for me will always be let down one of the most beautiful songs this group has ever made. i will always be floored by it when it comes on. while relistening to this again the climax of that song came in right when i put my foot down on the concrete while getting off of a bus and it felt earth-shattering to me. the second half from the apple text-to-speech monologue onwards is where this album drops a bit in quality. this is where i lose interest in listening to the rest of it. what bugs me about this side is that it is not as daring to experiment with other genres as the first side is. how do you go from the trip hop-tinged airbag to the above-average political ballad lucky? all of the songs here are not as great as the brit-pop centric ones from the bends either. i would rather put that album on again than sit through the run from electioneering to the tourist. so there it is after many a discussion with friends over this album i can finally say that ok computer is... good. i am honestly ready to put this one to rest. after the sessions for it were leaked and yorke released them officially with the profits going to extinction rebellion the greatest honeytrap protest in the 21st century the mystique of this album is dead to me. that is a write-up for another time.,1
there is nothing depressing about being in the presence of great art woody allen once said when discussing ingmar bergmans filmography. i echo the same sentiment here. sure thom yorke can be a little whiny. the music itself is a touch serious. but the hooks are still there and there is so much variety on display that ok computer never comes close to boring. aside from let down one of my all time favourite tracks i find airbag to be terribly underrated. it is a fantastic opener and sets the tone. stunning soundscapes all around fantastic guitar work. if you find thom yorkes vocals to be in any way pleasing to the ear you will love ok computer. just as i do. so is this the defacto greatest album of all time? who cares.,1
very dense album. there a layers of sound even on the couple straightforward rock songs mixed in that sound bends-ish. it is sound has changed quite a bit from distorted guitars on the bends. besides electioneering it has a brighter cleaner spacey sightly sterile tone. airbag - solid rocker that could be on the past albums. a lyrical killer cars sequel. 45 paranoid android this one shows all that they do so well. the besdt kind of epic. see-saws all over the place. impeccable. 55 exit music for a film - epic feel. love that fuzz pedal. then it ends so quietly. also the weird sound in the background is interesting. 55 let down - great lyrics such a good uplifting 90s song 55 karma police - one of the straightforward songs on here and a great for a minute there i lost myself i lost myself fitter happier - nice bit of weirdness and summation of the themes of the album. 45 electioneering - one of the few songs that could easily fit on the bends. they do not have many songs that rock with such looseness. 45 climbing up the walls - the sound of losing your mind. 55 no surprises - the music it a little too sweet for me but a good change from climbing up the walls i suppose. would not listen on it is own ever. 35 lucky - it is going to be a glorious day 55 the tourist - hey man slow down 55,1
this record is obviously one of the most important of all time has brought one of the best productions of his time with an amazing landscapes of maritime sounds sometimes setted on songs like airbag subterranean homesick alien parts of climbing up the walls and in the tourist. it peaked their best musical moment for the band. too sadly for me it did not hold the brillance of time... i would considered this a masterpiece 6 years ago even. it gets old for me now. spoiler click to read,1
even when i was not much of a radiohead fan i always thought of ok computer as an easy four-star record. now deciding to officially rate it i went on a little journey where i toyed very seriously with the idea of a lower rating. but in the end the quality of the album is kind of inarguable. back at the dawn of time when i was first poking around online music forums and properly becoming a nerd a forum friend once told me of his experience of cynics focus bear with me. prior to trying to branch into metal he was a very serious jazzfusionart rock fan so focus seemed like a natural way to try and explore the new genre. and as a jazz listener he initially clung to the jazzier tracks on the album textures especially. then as he grew into actually liking metal and not just tolerating it around his jazz he moved on to preferring how could i because who would not and saw textures for what it was  a fun and adventurous attempt at jazz fusion for a metal band but not a particularly strong fusion track in itself. electioneering was for me the rock i clung to when i first came to ok computer because it was the closest thing the album had to a hard rock song. nowadays.. i mean it is not a bad song. but now that i actually like the rest of the album and radiohead as a whole i just do not like it that much or at least do not feel compelled to listen to it. that was the first crack in my easy-four-star mentality. and then what about the tourist? is the tourist anyones favourite song? i listened to the album just yesterday and now i am sitting here writing a review of it and i cannot even remember what the tourist sounds like except for a feeling that it is too long. similarly lucky  not a bad song but i just do not really care plus lyrically and thematically it feels like it is covering ground airbag already covered better a few songs before. however. the highlights are pretty undeniable  airbag paranoid android let down exit music for a film subterranean homesick alien and no surprises are all top tier. karma police and climbing up the walls are probably right down at the bottom of this pile but they are still great. i do genuinely like fitter happier too even if it does not really count as a song. that is a strong collection of some of the best music of its era which makes a pretty strong case in the albums favour. and it still sounds like it fell into 1997 from some other place  not necessarily the future but despite boiling down to just five guys with regular rock instrumentation it does not quite sound like anything else. it is the attitude i guess it does not bother with the swagger of the brit-genre bands of the 90s and the bands it influenced going forward just seemed to take the vocals and turn them into whining without capturing anything else. whatever  there is a more articulate discussion than i am capable of to be had here and i am sure many others have already had it. ultimately i suppose i am in music for the sounds and the songs so for me this is just a collection of a few of the best.,1

fine. i give in. this is a great album. after listening to kid a i was not expecting something so immediately accessible and satisfying. lots of very very special transcendent musical moments. i will say though that this album is not perfect in my eyes. it is like a 4.89 so closer to a 5 but i really wish the album was tighter as an experience. even on the best songs here there are moments that drag instrumental and atmospheric indulgences that although they sound great make the album feel much longer than it is. and this may be a controversial take but i think they should have just cut no surprises. it is a lovely lovely song but it sounds sooo similar to let down to my ears and as pleasant as the song is it just does not stick out to me as an important moment on the album in an album chock-full of electrifying moments. i do not know i am definitely in the minority about this but removing the song would just make the album a bit tighter.,1
ok computer is an album with few flaws it distorts their sound on the bends and evolves it. i like how the album has a relatively slow start that makes paranoid android hit even harder than it would otherwise. after the loud almost white noice ending of paranoid android it basically breaks your fall in a sense with subterranean homesick alien which makes the song stand out. after this we get the calm and great song exit music for a film that works great as a slower song to relax to and makes it so the next song let down hits harder a whole. i could go on and on about the tracks and how well they flow into one another but i will leave you with this ok computer is a truly great album with lyrical depth and explores a lot of good themes it has a good flow but some times it can feel a little slow though it never gets boring. stand out tracks are paranoid android exit music for a film and no surprises for me personally.,1
this album shows the protagonists unwillingness and maybe also his uncapability to connect to society in the way it wants them to. the protagonist is lost feels alone confused angry and melancholic. it exposes our world order as chaotic and incomprehensible to the eyes of the sensitive one and although it does include the pariah clich it flaunts it well.,1
since everything that could be said about this album has been said on this site i will just give an unpolished review. airbag really is one of the greatest openers of all time to a rock album there is just a special quality to it that i will never be able to describe. paranoid android has one of the most exciting climaxes ever with a classic guitar solo. subterranean homesick alien is just great with it is weird twangy and aquatic-sounding guitars and exit music is so beautifully dreary. let down might be radioheads best song it is so dreamy and lush. anyway i do not have a lot to say about the other songs on here except i really agree with the sentiment of the tourist and it is a fitting closer for this album. it is not that the songs i do not have anything to say about are bad or anything they are all fantastic however electioneering is the one song that is slightly lackluster then the rest the chorus sounds a little generic. anyway i can forgive any flaws to this album because the guitar tone and the production is practically perfect. i just cannot give it a 5 because the second half is not as special to me as the first half. whatever though for all the complaining there is about this album there could be a lot worse albums out there.,1
radiohead is one of the bands that is always changing their sound and i like that about them. the one thing that is mostly always consistent with radiohead is that they make depressing music. the songs are good alternative rock with guitars and drums taking over the songs while a robotic voice and sounds take over on tracks like fitter happier. the song everyone knows off the album karma police is a great song and the entire album is amazing. the production is good songs are good everything about it is good. i enjoy radiohead but i can see why and agree why it is a modern classic.,1
right so i have a total of 5 reviews on my account. so what am i going to do about it? tackle what is considered by many to be the best album of all time because i am obviously qualified to do so. i am also fairly new to radiohead so yeah. but for real i do not think this is the greatest album of all time or anything but i do really love it. of the 4 radiohead albums i have heard so far this is my favorite. so let us dive into it. the first song here is airbag which honestly i think is alright. i like it but it does not grip me that much and i think it is overhyped amongst the fan base. the lyrics are solid though. the next song is paranoid android and while i have no idea what this song is about i do not care. it sounds awesome. the heavy breakdown in this song is probably my favorite moment in a radiohead song and i love it and this song. then we get subterranean homesick alien which sounds good and has a good concept about wanting to be abducted by aliens because you do not feel at home amongst humans. then we get the ominous exit music for a film and i absolutely love it. i love the romeo and juliet-based story it tells the buildup in instrumentation and thoms voice. you also do not see many songs that end with the line we hope that you choke. that darkness then transitions into let down which is the saddest song here and i love it. thom sounds great here the guitar is beautiful and it has lyrics about a feeling we can all relate to disappointment. i love this one. then we get the big single karma police. i love this song because not only does it sound good but the lyrics here are important. with the introduction of cancel culture to the internet this song has more meaning than ever. no idea what it means in 1997 but the accusatory lines and the lines saying i have given all i can but it is not enough perfectly exemplify what i feel cancel culture does. to start off the second half we get the dark interlude fitter happier. it does not have much meaning outside of the album but i love the dark atmosphere it creates. then we get fun political anthem electioneering which is led by cowbell percussion and a catchy hook. i do not know why but i did not come back to this song like i thought i would. then we get climbing up the walls which is considered the first of radioheads creepy songs. and i do not like it. it has both this creepy atmosphere and also a very slow and boring feel to it and it just does not interest me. it is not awful but it is my least favorite here. then we get my favorite off my album no surprises. the instrumentation here is absolutely beautiful bordering on a lullaby. i also love the lyrics about just wanting a normal happy life with no alarms and no surprises. absolutely love it. then we get lucky which is very similar to airbag and i have similar thoughts. i like it well enough. finally this album closes with the tourist which is an appropriately slow song reminding us to slow down and enjoy life using the metaphor of a busy tourist to deliver this message. just slow down and enjoy the scenery around you. overall really good album. i would not call it the best album of all time like so many others would but i see where they are coming from. my main problem here is just a couple songs that do not really grip me. favorites include no surprises let down paranoid android karma police exit music for a film the tourist subterranean homesick alien and electioneering. my only least favorite here is climbing up the walls. i would give this a light 910. definitely recommend for any music lover.,1
the ideological blackmail that has been in place since the original live aid concerts in 1985 has insisted that caring individuals could end famine directly without the need for any kind of political solution or systemic reorganization. it is necessary to act straight away we were told politics has to be suspended in the name of ethical immediacy. bonos product red brand wanted to dispense even with the philanthropic intermediary. philanthropy is like hippy music holding hands bono proclaimed. red is more like punk rock hip hop this should feel like hard commerce. the point was not to offer an alternative to capitalism - on the contrary product reds punk rock or hip hop character consisted in its realistic acceptance that capitalism is the only game in town. no the aim was only to ensure that some of the proceeds of particular transactions went to good causes. the fantasy being that western consumerism far from being intrinsically implicated in systemic global inequalities could itself solve them. all we have to do is buy the right products. -mark fisher 1968-2017 thought it was the least good of radioheads supposed masterpieces when i was like 13. continues to overlap most things i can think of since then. as far as a definitive artistic statement of neoliberalisms mass psychology it does not really get much better than this.,1
what can i say about this album that has not been said before? nothing. albums pretty good though.,1
almost all of my friends do not have the yearning for new and different types of music that i do. in fact i doubt hardly any of them have even listened to this album in full. ok computer is the first album that i have listened too that captures the loneliness that is pursuing new music when the vast majority does not give a shit about the quality of what goes in their ears. thom and the gang let me know that no matter how radically different my music taste to that of the people i spend the most time with but let me know that my pursuit of quality is worth it to the highest degree.,1
have you not listened to the album yet or something? i thought that was like a pre-requisite to joining this site yknow. so go do that then come back and agree with everyone saying it is one of the best albums ever made. because it is. to this day let down remains up there with my absolute fav tracks made by anyone and it alone would give this album a classic status for me. yet it is just one out of a dozen other just as good classics even electioneering is awesome even if a little out-of-the-blue. definitely the album of my generation.,1
listened to this for the first time today during the song no surprises while he was repeating no alarms and no surprises the music suddenly stopped as my system had glitched out but it said it was still playing. i thought it was part of the music an ironic surprise. positive first impressions overall.,1
after a questionable debut taking many of the worst aspects of alt rock at the time and their solid more refined followup album the bends radiohead perfected their initial sound here in their third album ok computer. rather than many tracks that could come off as simple ok computer adds layers upon layers of sound to each track giving the entire album a spacey futuristic atmosphere with droning electronic noise on top of distorted guitar paving the way for some simply excellent soundscapes and atmosphere to complement the alt rock sound that the album has pushing it far above what would be expected of such an album. the album keeps its sound very cohesive all throughout a constant tone that is extremely serious and at times depressing. the first track airbag starts the album off extremely strong with many elements that when listened to closely almost seem as if they are playing slightly different songs especially the bass which plays a riff very similar to that of porcupine trees hatesong while the other instruments drone on with the aforementioned electronic noises appearing throughout all as thom yorke sings in his unique way putting emotion into the music while simultaneously almost sounding as if he does not really care which ends up working out in the songs favour quite significantly. paranoid android is an easy choice for best song on the album or by the band in general a 3 piece song that simply builds upon itself in each section starting off with beautiful layered riffs over a vocal melody that set up the extremely dark tone of it complete with some breathtaking moments particularly the hook. the song then takes on a much heavier approach toning down the sonic depth and instead making each individual note from each instrument along with vocals be filled with power all before the third section simply blows everything else out of the water with some of the most perfect use of vocal harmonies and layering i have ever heard with amazing use of mellotron on top of this leading to one of the most powerful moments on the album. after this point the majority of the tracks can be put into one of two categories the extremely atmospheric relaxing songs and the ones that are extremely tied to the alternative rock roots of the band. subterranean homesick alien lucky and the tourist all fit into this category for me all heavily focusing on capturing particular emotions and tones rather than making a catchy song each sounding simply beautiful with the last 2 closing off the album amazingly with a gradual decrease in any sort of intensity emotional or otherwise until the tourist comes on which is by far the most relaxing song on the album and by the band in general. on the other end of the spectrum let down karma police electioneering and no surprises all make for very solid alt rock tunes with a lot of real depth to each track in terms of sound even though the songs themselves seem very simple. electioneering is the exception to this having a simple structure but also being very simple and riff driven instead with a fun heavily distorted riff that simply allows one to rock out. exit music for a film marks easily the most impactful moment on the album gradually building as everything distorts starting off as a standard track before ending in something incredibly powerful and cathartic as even thom yorkes usual droning vocals feel much more solemn here. climbing up the walls takes the atmosphere a step further by not making it depressing as much as eerie bordering on downright terrifying with everything having a scratchy quality to it. the song has a very distant isolated feel to it with very sparing use of any sort of sound with the drum beat being incredibly monotonous and simplistic with any other noise being infrequent bringing even more attention to the heavy vocal distortion. the other sounds begin coming in as the song progresses constantly making everything feel more claustrophobic with even the beautiful string arrangements simply serving to add more contrast to the unpleasant elements of the song all ending in a chilling scream. fitter happier is an odd track to me because while all it provides is creepiness i feel like it ties the album together despite how musically poor it is since there is very little there other than a robotic voice and minimalistic piano. this is definitely an incredible album no matter what genre you insist on putting it in. it is filled with powerful emotion immersive atmosphere and expert use of a wide variety of techniques subsequently leading to a collection of sonically complex compositions each sounding beautiful and simultaneously impressive when looked at closer. radiohead significantly refined and improved their sound from their previous two efforts adding a level of complexity and atmosphere to their alternative rock roots making for a simply incredible album all around. best songs paranoid android exit music for a film climbing up the walls karma police worst songs none verdict an extremely good album with a lot of complexity to it masked by a commercial sound making it quite easy to listen to while also being quite interesting to analyse. recommended to anyone who will not whine about a somewhat commercial sound.,1
well i finally got around to listen to this album for the first time after buying it a year or so ago. everybody loves this album in the music discussionhipster sphere and i finally see why. holy crap on a cracker this album is excellent! i have not heard an album that was given the infamous greatest album of all time label and held up to that title since maybe to pimp a butterfly and i love that album so much that it became my manifesto! ok computer pulls out all the stops to influence a listener who is looking for a special album. it melds its contemporaries and influences from other acts that pushed the envelope of rock music and makes them their own to push that envelope further. this one little album caused an explosion in the music world the likes of which the world has not seen since king crimsons in the court of the crimson king. not only that it broke my heart and then put it back together numerous times throughout its runtime leaving me so overjoyed that i laughed like i have just proposed to the love of my life and she said yes. wow! i always start with the production so let us start with it again. ok computers mixing at first glance is that standard singer buried in the mix thing that i do not like about more than a few rock records. and there is an element of that but once a song like exit music for a film hits i cannot stay mad at this record for long. that song and many songs like that are mixed very well. in fact thoms vocals are more dynamic than vocalists on a lot of albums i have heard due to this very phenomenon quite fascinatingly and a bit annoyingly. thom yorke opts to be another instrument as opposed to leading the charge which is what i would usually prefer. but this is ok computer so this album is special. partially because all the instruments are crystal clear. the digital and analog elements of this album are each handled with care particularly the drums which are a part of the driving force of this albums emotional intensity. ok computer balances both digital and analog through its expert sound play. from the first few second of airbag we get a melding of acoustic and electronic in the drums. this theme is of course found throughout the album. we find it on let down with the overbearing synths and the little acoustic guitar in the left corner. such thematic brilliance which i will discuss later is not possible without stellar production. the production of this record fits every peak and valley radiohead come up with. we get a brash style of production on electioneering to fit with the brashness of the instrumentation i mean the guitars and especially those drums are as in your face as radiohead gets on that album and more psychedelic and echoey on songs like subterranean homesick alien. there are songs like exit music for a film which are conflicted between warm and cold which are also handled really well from a productions standpoint. this record really has it all! speaking of having it all the composition of ok computer is incredible! there is a conflict between analog and digital on this record and both elements bring it to the fullest extent on this record. the synths on this album have a very artificial sound that plays into the themes for example the bridge and especially the ending of let down and the crashing down in karma police. there are also little beeps boops and samples throughout ok computer that make this album feel that much more artificial. it is hard to come up with good example because an example of this is on nearly every track. the noise way in the background of exit music for a film the ringing in lucky the synthetic voices in both aforementioned tracks and the entirety of fitter happier are a few of many examples of the cold digital side of this album. but we also get the beautiful acoustic aspects of this album. the drums i have already mentioned are excellent. the bass adds a nice flavour to each track. it is sparse on airbag and is yet somehow more noticeable. the pianos are beautiful on karma police particularly. the synths can be warm as well such as on subterranean homesick alien. the guitar fits well with every song on this album. it is clean when it needs to be and explosive on others. for a guitar led album the guitar never let us this album be one-dimensional. there are so many things i could gush on about with this records composition. first off i will mention the intricacy of each track. there are often so many moving parts to these songs that all fit together so well. particularly the synths on subterranean homesick alien that never fail to make me melt. each track is beautifully arranged. i could go on for another paragraph on the masterpiece that is paranoid android with how seamlessly it transitions from one movement to the other. let us just say it got my bohemian rhapsody award for best song with multiple parts in its respective decade for a reason. it is an amazing diverse track. speaking of diversity ok computer has it all in its composition. it has dark songs like exit music for a film absolute bangers like electioneering and everything in between. whatever mood you may have ok computer has you covered. with this diversity comes the influence of this album. it borrows from pink floyd in their hey day as well as a bit of beach boys and the clash. i even heard a bit of chick coreas spain a famous jazz song for those who do not know in exit music for a film. while taking a leaf from other musical revolutionaries future acts would come along and take a leaf out of radioheads book. let down sounds like many alt-rock songs that would come after particularly snow patrols chasing cars which i loved as a kid when it came out and i still love now. as well as influencing more acts i grew up with such as muse the killers and coldplay. as such let down as well as a lot of this album feels like a warm hug. what really sticks with me about this albums its lyrical content. the lyrics themselves are not wordy at all compared to other rate your musicpitchfork darlings cough itaots but radiohead is very effective with what they say on this album enough to make me burst into tears of sheer joy. they are delivered by a thom yorke who throws an emotional gauntlet onto the listener. while there are times where i cannot understand what thoms singing due in part to the nature of his voice and the production focussing more on vocal dynamic range. his voice however follows the tone that each song is going for which adds to each songs potency. he sounds beaten down and dejected on certain songs and he has passionate highs as well which i absolutely adore. as for lyrical analysis i feel as though this album is more than what people say it is. through both the passive and active research i conducted for this album the general consensus was that ok computer was about the dangers of technology and how the machines were taking over and making our lives miserable. while there is an element of that this would be a far preachier and therefore far worse album if that were the only thing that it brought to the table. my personal analysis is that ok computer is not so much warning us about evil robots and technology taking our jobs but more worried about becoming more machine-like mirroring the technology we created in 1997 and have been creating since. ok computer is begging us to not be tricked into thinking that our current fast-paced society is not only the right way to live but the only way to live. from the eviction of a near-death experience in airbag to the bleakness of fitter happier to the blasting of tony blair in electioneering to the closer the tourist literally begging us to slow down and enjoy our lives. this album is a lyrical powerhouse that taps into my emotions in more ways than one and really that is all i can ask for from music. all my favourite albums do just that. in conclusion i wish i listened to this album a lot sooner than i did but better late than never i guess. right before i listened to ok computer i felt an enticing aura about it. as if it was beckoning me to listen to it. now after all the times i have listened to this masterpiece all i can really say is wow. i was wowed by how well this album was produced teaching me about the importance of dynamics even if it fits the dreaded rock trope of the singer not sitting atop the mix as the main melody should. the album also blends analog and digital together effortlessly creating a sound that balances warm and cold that makes the album unique. each track adds a different element to ok computer and enriches it with a wide variety of sounds and emotion. every instrument shows up and is incredibly important to these beautifully intricate tracks that are arranged so masterfully that they remind me of what swans would do with to be kind years later. speaking of years later this one album caused an alternative rock revolution that i was lucky enough or unlucky enough depending on who you ask to experience in my childhood. all this while borrowing sounds from various visionaries of radioheads time which makes ok computer a prime example of how no great albums are an island unto themselves and the importance of experimentation in music. i have written all this as a part of my closing paragraph and i have not even gotten into the lyrics yet. their lyrics are poignant and tell the story of human dejection in the modern age. ok computer argues that if we are not careful our actions will reflect the machines we create to the point where we are indistinguishable from the robots. this album reiterates the importance of living in the moment and affirming your life as a human being. this album is a crown jewel in rock music history and inspires me to go outside and tell the world that i am indeed a human being and i will live every moment of my life as well as i can. it is not the best album of all time in my opinion as to pimp a butterfly exists and has my undying adoration but ok computer is a benchmark in rock history and honestly i can see why people really love this album. honestly its not far off from being my favourite either and i hope you will find the time to experience it yourself.,1
there is not much about ok computer that has not already been said so i do not feel a need to write about its legacy and significance and context and whatnot. ok computer is one of those albums that took a really long time to appreciate. from the first time i heard it until i would say mid-august of 2018 i really did not get it and it seemed really abstract but some select songs stuck with me. between mid-august 2018 to mid-january 2019 i was in a state of denial of me seriously liking a radiohead album and i tried picking through all of its trivial flaws to justify not giving it a perfect score and saying yeah definitely not their best nah not the best album of the 1990s. i gave in. this is not the best album of the 1990s though it is probably the most significant. i will start with the albums flaws because it is a cracked 10 stars. 1. between the outstanding karma police and the haunting climbing up the walls it is clumsy and awkward. fitter happier is not bad and it has its place in the loose concept of the album but it would not be a big deal if it was removed. it is well-written in the sense that it reinforces the modern hysteria and anxiety but some lines are just awkward like a pig in a cage on antibiotics. it ends on a dramatic note and then transitions into electioneering one of the bands least charismatic songs that is not bad but extremely underwhelming. the worst elements of muse followed this song i guess. 2. its ending is underwhelming. bouncing back from the aforementioned songs you have two of the albums highest points and then you have two great but not particularly exceptional or high songs. i would be fine if this ended with lucky because that could serve as a fantastic closer. the line pull me oooouuuuuuuuuuut of the aircrash pull me oooouuuuuuuuut of the lake would work so well if this closed a loose concept album that started with airbag. yes there is a difference between a car crash and an airplane crash but still. i do not have many flaws of lucky but the tourist kind of plods along as the second longest song on the album but is not that exciting or climactic. on its own it is not worth much but it does not offer a cliffhanger or exciting ending to an exceptional album. still it is nice and atmospheric. 3. sometimes it takes itself a bit too seriously. this is not a major flaw because it is an alternative rock album released in the 90s and 90s alt. rock borrowed a lot of the excess of the 80s and just condensed it into other areas. i avoid or try to avoid using pretentious in critiques of art but the melancholy and futuristic concepts of the album open it up for many of these critiques even if they are not the most valid. basically it is not an album i am always in the mood for. but when i am in the mood for it it hits like a charm. with these flaws aside the rest of the album is perfect. if the highs outweigh the lows so be it. because they absolutely outweigh the three main flaws above. i used to think the middle section was a bit dull but i have come to appreciate that stretch. airbag is a humble opener that hints at something greater and futuristic combining some more modern sounds to a standard alternative tune and given what comes after it is very modest and not-so-telling. this is good. on paranoid android radiohead declared themselves the greatest band of their time. it is an utterly ridiculous song too. i love bohemian rhapsody  i am in love with my car and its bombast playfulness contrast and passage-linking like many do and this song still blew my mind the first time i heard it. it is more serious and intense than bohemian and better too. like the opener this starts off humble and you would not expect it to be that avant-garde and revolutionary. it is acoustic but also spacey and atmospheric. the melody is nice and all but it also has that sense of dread and fear to it showing the contrast between a more upbeat sound and an anxious and looming passage. as the lyrics grow darker it gets more tense. you get a sick guitar solo and then it abruptly switches to a moody atmospheric and anxious passage that is just sick. this is the part where it blew my mind the first time i heard it. fuck everything about this song is stunning and perfectly put together. the last minute and climax is also incredible and this song is where the band declared yeah we are better than you and gave a f.you. to the industry and also to the bends. the stretch between subterranean homesick alien a definitive indie song title and karma police is outstanding consistent and astonishing. karma police was probably the first radiohead song i ever loved and this was at the time where i strongly disliked the band outside of creep 15 step and this. a fantastic piano psuedo-ballad with strong hints of downtempo and trip hop to it amazing how it works out. exit music for a film is jawbreaking and whatever film it is for it is sure as hell a dark and surreal film. it starts off with guitar chords telling of melancholy and rain and does not get any more positive from there. the mellotron and organ and depressed chords do a lot for atmosphere sure but i have noticed that the looped sample playing in the background-indistinguishable but present-does a lot to make it more abstract. and the bass synth helps too-that section of the song is insane. let down is probably the most upbeat song here but not exactly positive or happy. the jangly guitars over futuristic production are great and the songwriting and arrangements are spot-on. it is bittersweet and melodic and fits in really well. subterranean.. is fantastic and a nice breath of air coming off the mammoth paranoid android and substantially more positive than exit music... climbing up the walls and no surprises are not songs that i instantly liked or fell in love with as said before i used to find the middle stretch to be a bit weak. fuck me because if climbing up the walls is not the perfect song for when you have reached rock bottom and do not know where to go or if you should ever both climbing up see what i did there? then what is? jesus is that song haunting or what? while electioneering preceded it with spooky samples sounding like the gates were just opened and began with a riff out the door this starts off spacey and somber with colins downtempo bass and the looped sample. the distorted vocals are sick. i cannot tell you how much i love the production on the album. no surprises always reminded me of let down in how it is disguised as an upbeat breath of air but the lyrics still resonate with the rest of the album. i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide is pretty telling of the 21st century. the entire first verse for that matter should not go over peoples heads as easily as it does. but hey when it starts off with that soft melody like it is a damn r.e.m. song i can understand why it does. also it sounds like he is signing salaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad instead of sileeeeeeeeeeeeeeeence. never was the best vocalist in the world. yeah i think all of that beats the three aforementioned flaws here. i guess it is the definitive college rock album and it came out 22 years ago. and it is still as relevant as its successor kid a. which one is better? i honestly do not know. both mean a lot to me but if i did not revisit kid a and come to realize how amazing it is i do not know if i would have checked out the rest of radioheads discography. i have listened to this so many times since august though. as an album this works incredibly well but even on their own most of the songs here work quite well. paranoid android is my personal favorite song from the bands wide discography just because of how mindblowing it was the first time i heard it in march 2018. it is still wild. it is also my pick for the best song of the 1990s because no other song was quite as ambitious and eclectic as that. karma police is also comfortably in my top 50 songs of all time and exit music... and climbing up the walls are in heavy rotation. fuck i do not know why i waited so long to admit to loving this. thank you rym. 1010

ok computer is a wonderful exploration of the modern first world society. radiohead analyses in depth and gives their opinion on the divide in power superficiality and feelings of rejection from society all whilst creating a highly atmospheric and emotional masterpiece that is ever relevant and meaningful as humanity succumbs to madness.,1
i am currently listening through all of the top-rated albums on rym in order and figured why not pen a couple of sentences as i do for my own benefit later. radioheads ok computer is very familiar to me as i was already a fan back in the 90s before it came out. and even though with the benefit of hindsight i no longer really think of it as the goat or maybe even as the best radiohead album anymore i get why it commonly gets top ranking in charts like these. this feels like the first album of the internet age. there is something other-worldly about this album that is so hard to pin-point and even harder to recreate. they took the brooding pop charm of the bends and lifted into a cloud like alternative rock was having an out-of-body experience. radiohead are simultaneously the mystics guiding the spiritual journey and the emts on the scene doing chest compressions and injecting cortisone. they are the night shift hospital janitors watching the body roll in on a gurney. they are subterranean homesick aliens making home movies for the folks back home. in any case ok computer felt like a sea change in rock music and i get why it is still lauded to this day. favorite tracks exit music let down no surprises,1
ok computer- radiohead 1997 a landmark album of the 90s and one of my favorites of the decade. it was a huge leap from radioheads first album pablo honey and perfected the themes and experimentation they were toying with in their sophomore album the bends. many people listen to this album and see it as nothing more than a really good alternative rock album as they fail to truly delve into what makes the album stand out. it is true radiohead did stick to somewhat typical rock musical structures while still have the transitions and experimentation reminiscent that of progressive rock however that part of their vision would not be fully realized until kid a their lyrical content and eerie foreshadowing of the 21st century are what is key here. they somehow are able to encapsulate the feeling of post-modern society with all of our technological advancements and things like social media when back in that day it was just slow massive computers that could at must run doom. along with the lyrics a large portion of the youth in the 90s really had not listened to much music that surpassed conventional rock structures and on ok computer radiohead often step out of those boundaries the song that everyone likes to point out and with good reason is paranoid android. the song features a fairly run of the mill acoustic session in the beginning with thom yorkes signature vocals. after two verses and a chorus the chorus is played a second time however it does not break back into the acoustic playing from the beginning. instead the mood slightly shifts and thom whines a melody behind the new guitar chords. when he starts to sing the lyrics the tone is noticeably darker an electric guitar shocks in with a power chord and the song just goes balls to the wall with a guitar solo and some whammy bar whacking. it then calms down into another acoustic section before ending with another explosive electric distortion and effect filled solo with distorted scream vocals in the background. the innovative musical content with the lyrics describing a life of loneliness and isolation that would come to be the lives of many teenagers in the 21st century make this an album that will never be forgotten and will always be beloved. i give it a solid 910. favorite tracks paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police,1
i am not going to waste your time here. this album is stunning and powerful and i am sure you have already heard this. a shining achievement for rock music and one of my personal favorite albums. in my opinion this blows kid a out of the water. the 1990s greatest album. favorite tracks let down paranoid android no surprises subterranean homesick alien the tourist climbing up the walls least favorite tracks none,1
i am planning on reviewing the top ten albums on this site and first is ok computer. the bends started to show radiohead as a great band that was something special and ok computer did nothing but confirm it. the way radiohead combines electronic elements with alternative rock in grandiose fashion is pretty great. tracks airbag this song has thom telling the story of how an airbag saved someone is life after getting into a car crash. the melodies of this song always get stuck in my head and the intro to this song is really eye catching. ear catching? i do not know. well this song is a really great intro to the album. paranoid android another incredibly catchy song on the album i love the production. build up to when he says you do not remember you do not remember why do not you remember my name. most of the song shows thom being bitter against someone likely spoiled and greedy saying ambition makes you look pretty ugly. kicking screaming gucci little piggy. lol. subterranean homesick alien i really the hazy dreamy atmosphere of the production on this song. in this song thom theorizes about the extraterrestrial with an almost childlike curiosity. love how the drums kick in for the chorus. exit music for a film this may be my favorite song off the whole album. the song may not be the most bold and upfront song on the album but the emotion that thom puts into this song makes this the saddest radiohead song i have heard so far. i love how the production crescendos in the fourth verse. the lyrics are very heartfelt and talk about wanting to escape away from troubled you are being faced with. let down the lyrics on this song are some of the best on the album. to me it is talking about depression. the bug being crushed a metaphor for all of lifes baggage weighing down negatively on your mood. the line bouncing back and one day i am going to grow wings i feel feeds into the theme of escapism present in the album. karma police hot take but i believe that this is the worst song on the album. its still a good song but i have always found the verses a bit annoying and the production and lyrics have never seemed quite up to par with the rest of the songs. chorus and outro are pretty catchy though. fitter happier definitely a weirder song on the album which features a robot from the future talking about humans and what they should be like. the production behind this has a certain creepiness to it that is hard to shake off. electioneering after a series of subtle songs ending in fitter happier electioneering crashes in unexpectedly. in contrast with most of the rest of the album this song is noisy and catchy as hell. underrated and easily one of my favorites from the album. the riffs and cowbell on this album are very fun. climbing up the walls this song both succeeds in being creepy and catchy at the same time and i love how thom sings the chorus and how distorted the production gets with the outro and thom basically screaming climbing up waaals. no surprises unlike climbing up walls this song has a very calming atmosphere that is difficult to describe. it reminds me of a mother singing a lullaby to a child and reassuring them that everything is going to be alright. the song has very sad lyrics that keep up the empty and depressive theme on the album a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal you look so tired unhappy the production is not grandiose but very calming and beautiful in subtle ways. lucky this song has one of the most alien sounding and grand choruses on the album. this song lyrically has a positive and optimistic theme around ignoring the negative influences and working to better yourself. the tourist. this song kind of reminds me of parts of dark side of the moon for whatever reason. i really like thoms vocals on this song. he has a way of conveying emotions of sadness and melancholy like not many others. i feel that the album would not be anywhere as close to how great as it is if it was sang by anyone else. date released 6161997 genres alternative rock art rock best tracks exit music for a film electioneering climbing up the walls airbag paranoid android no surprises lucky worst tracks karma police rating high 910. incredible album and despite how much people overate radiohead on this site this album deserves the praise it has gotten. from forward thinking themes of dystopian society to themes of depression and feeling like an outsider this album makes a statement. this album sonically sounds from another universe as it uses key changes and unique time signatures in its own way. the fusion of art rock with electronic elements was unique and influential for the albums for years to come. give this album a few listens if it does not click right away its amazing work. that is it for my shitty review. if any of the themes i have said around the album are incorrect my bad its just what i got from the music.,1
what is up rym it is been awhile since i wrote a review here and i quite like the whole bulletpoint format. i am not sure if it fits what i am going to put here but i am going to use it anyways because writing formats are just a construct anyways. a. it is been a good 4-5 years now since the peak music-hunting part of my life. a combination of disillusionment with music school and a host of other factors kind of pulled me away from focusing on music as much as i used to. 2. the past few days i have been desperately searching for some artist or album to hit me with that spark i used to feel in the early 2010s. the inspiration and fire of listening to spiritualizeds ladies and gentlemen... for the first time. not finding it i decided to revisit this album which i had listened to nearly a decade ago but had nearly left my mind. it was not listening to it for the first time but it was a close as anybody could get.  i am not sure if this album scratches that itch. i am not sure if any music really can anymore. maybe i have been around the block one too many times. this album is innovative but i find myself thinking about the chord progressions the small harmonic surprises the influences from nearly every style of music we have seen since the 1950s the fuzzy bass tone on exit music the prominent piano on karma police. it is like i have lost my music innocence. i desperately want to be able to listen to this album outside the context of knowing where it came from or the kind of music it would spawn.  while i find myself able to identify a great portion of what is going on here the album still takes me by surprise at every turn and therein lies what i love about it. every nook and cranny of this album has been considered and if there was something that could be added or removed to remove the album those things have been consequently added or removed.  calling something perfect is a pretty hack move but i am just not creative enough to be able to think of a way to make this album better. i am not sure if anybody is. rated as a 4.5 for the time being as i only rate albums as 5s on secondary listenings and considerations. i imagine this one will have no problem crossing that bridge though.,1
yeah there is this little underground band i know called radiohead they wrote this album it is like really good it is probably uh i do not know the best album of all time or you know something to that effect. it is a shame that it is almost required to preface this thing with a disclaimer about how you think it is actually not the greatest album of all time. truly the hottest take. but when you have been the number one highest rated album on a popular music forum for years now there is not much you can do in the outset of a review than to let people know that you are not going to completely suck off the artist and their work. that being said ok computer has become such a legendary work that it is still talked about today it still feels fresh and the messy scraps of recordings that were produced during its development somehow managed to crack 3.75 stars on this site. this is definitely radioheads most celebrated work with only kid a competing but this one is certainly seen as the more accessible of the two and with good reason. i myself was not overly fond of this album the first time i heard it at the age of 17 and i had to listen to it three times over the course of about a year before i really enjoyed it. it is more accessible than some of radioheads other work but that does not mean that it is not at all challenging to listen to the first go around but hey at the time my music taste had not really extended far beyond classic rock. so is it the greatest album of all time? could be. i am not going to argue that it is as it is not even my favorite radiohead work but i think that it is certainly worth a good bit of the praise that is heaped upon it. the opening riff of airbag is perhaps my favorite introduction to any album ever. i am not saying the entire song maintains this level of awe-inspiration but everything before the drum track kicks in is so goddamn cool sounding that i still let out an audible and excited oh when it comes up on my phone. since it is not set against anything and is right at the beginning the riff just comes out like it is the heaviest thing in all of music and i adore it. when the song picks up the phrase wall of sound comes to mind in a way that i do not associate with a lot of the other music i listen to. there is so many different sounds happening and yet none of it becomes overwhelming to the point that it is just noise. yorkes performance on this song is nothing particularly special but it is serviceable. although as an aside i would like to say that the lyric an angel at my door as it was revealed on the leaked minidiscs is far better than the jack-knifed juggernaut line they ended up using on the official release. this song also does a great job of setting up the albums dichotomy of reliance on technology versus the fear of technology in ways that are not one hundred percent apparent on the first lesson but are more than obvious each time you revisit it. my big issue with this song lies in the instrumental breaks which i do not find nearly as interesting as the writers must have. still though this is a great album opener a 45 147 listens. i think that paranoid android does a much better job of capturing the style and spirit of this record than the introductory song and also has much more thrust to it as well. i mean this song is just fantastic. the music video still does not make a lick of sense to me but that does not detract from the song itself in anyway. this is one of yorkes best and most memorable performances on the album and perhaps in the entire radiohead discography. his effortless falsetto throughout the song is spectacular no matter which of the three distinct sections of the song he traverses. the first section of this song is a great slice of rock any way you look at it. the lyrics can come across as somewhat nonsensical but the huge drop on you do not remember you do not remember is such a well-earned moment but still can come as a bit of a jolting surprise if you are not paying close attention. the bread and butter of this song however is the middle rain down section of the song. it maintains the percussion in a more slow rock style while the other instruments drop out in favor of these ah vocalizations layered heavily on top of each other all the while yorke delivers a harrowing melodic performance atop the surgically-precise harmonies. this bit is one of my favorite moments on the entire album and comes so soon as if to motivate one to keep listening. just when the initial shock of this slow chanting section has subsided it jolts back to the rock feel but with considerably more energy than it offered prior to the second section. the third section is a great outro harkening back to radioheads work on the bends which is always a joy to revisit in my book. this song earns high high marks. it is six and a half minutes long and does not feel that long at all so it clearly earns a 55 255 listens. subterranean homesick alien has grown on me within the past two-ish months. while i initially found this song lacking in substance and viewed it as a less-talented little brother to paranoid android i have come around to enjoying it as a bridge between that song and the next. it is a necessary step to calm the listener after the high octane ending of its last song. i have also come to appreciate the narrative spun in the lyrics of this song making the words of this piece some of my favorite on the album as a whole. the concept of an alien coming to earth and feeling nervous and isolated looking down on the collective fear of the human race is such a great topic for a song. yorke is an expert at writing songs about isolation and being a wallflower. this song really runs into problems with how repetitive it is as if they had only one idea that they could derive the four minutes from. particularly the chorus of the song is rather bland to me. still this is just a small nick on an otherwise great atmospheric piece. the song still narrowly meets a 45 to me 110 listens. i think most people who were not really fond of this album on their first listen like myself still found immense enjoyment in exit music for a film. this song contextualizes the winding-down that began with track 3 starting with this gentle solo guitar line and barely stretching beyond that for a good bit of the song. yorkes performance in this song is fantastic perhaps his eeriest effort in this whole collection save for one other track climbing up the walls. the song builds slightly in the second verse making you think it will go somewhere but when it goes back down in the third verse it convinces you otherwise which is what makes it so jaw-dropping when the sound explodes in the fourth verse. i remember being floored by this song and it still gets me every now and again. definitely a goosebumps-inspiring drop. i love how my expectations for the song to come back down at the end of this verse were denied and substituted with yorke going up further and wailing on we hope your words and wisdom choke you. the magic of this song is hard to articulate in writing but anyone who listens to it should be able to agree with why i am giving it a 55 326 listens. directly out of the last masterpiece comes another one in the form of let down. this one is by far my favorite on the album and i am glad that so many people have also come around to this state of mind in recent years. there is a bit of an inside joke amongst radiohead fans now that let down is an underrated masterpiece. shout out to rletdownappreciation. you are doing gods work. i digress. let down is undoubtedly the most pop rock endeavor on the album and perhaps one of radioheads most accessible works. i was surprised to find that they do not often play this one live because it is too complicated. when i read that i took a closer listen to the song and began to understand. towards the end philip goes absolutely nuts on the drums in a way that i feel like i will never fully be able to comprehend. throughout the song the drum track is one of my favorite bits  i often find myself beating along to it with my hands when i listen to the song. it is unique for a song that sounds so much like a pop rock song. this song is also where i think that ok computer begins to revel in the beauty of its own depressing world which is expanded upon in the tenth track. this song is undoubtedly a bummer an anthem about being disappointed and dissatisfied and yet it delivers the most touching bridge in any song i have ever heard. yorkes falsetto on the repeated you know where you are over the chorus at the end is absolute musical ecstasy. the song is five and half minutes and feels like a standard three minute banger. i have nothing but praise for this song. it is one of my top 3 radiohead songs ever written making it an obvious 55 song 677 listens. and speaking of absolute bangers here comes karma police! i believe after creep this is radioheads most well-known song and i am mostly okay with that let down is better but whatever. the groove in this song is undeniable from the very first measure. the bass line rocks the percussion is powerful the piano fills in the chorus are chilling. radiohead has described two songs on this album as funny and this is one of them the other being paranoid android. not funny as in interesting but funny as in ha-ha leading me to believe that this band is comprised of some of the most hilariously not funny people on the planet  this songs outro consists of yorke repeating for a minute there i lost myself. is not that just hilarious? perhaps they were being ironic and the sarcasm went over my head but at any rate it still amuses me a great deal. also another note about the lyrics being changed originally they had arrest this girl she stares at me as if she owns the world and changed it to arrest this girl her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill which is a way worse line. regardless this song still absolutely goes off. the only knock against it and it is not even really the songs fault is that it is less inventive and less interesting than the song that comes right before it. this song is definitely on the high end of a 45 for me 266 listens. it is hard to count fitter happier as a song at all. if you count it as one it is certainly not a good one. however it is crucial to understanding this album as this is the point at which the switch is flipped and the dystopic nature of the latter half is overtly established. you definitely do not skip this song when you give the record a full listen even though its uncomfortable atmosphere is almost suffocating. many of my friends hate this song as it gives them severe anxiety. i think it accomplishes exactly what it needs to  it tells the listener to prepare for a new tone. rather than being about the depressing state of society the second half will be about how nightmarish it will become if we let technology supersede the human element. i love the piano and background noise of this song and i am very glad they released it on the oknotok cassette tape in 2017 it is almost laughably grim. i will say that maybe fitter happier comes across as a bit over-the-top kind of on-the-nose. there is no subtlety to it. but perhaps that is the point. as a song on its own it is definitely a 15 but as a part of a whole it is at least a 35 101 listens. it took me so long to figure out that the beginning of electioneering was a cage rattling which is a nice touch to connect it to the final line of fitter happier a pig in a cage on antibiotics. people have suggested that radiohead should have replaced electioneering with the song lift from the oknotok re-release but i could not disagree more. not only does it eliminate the narrative through line that the song shares with fitter happier lift does not fit at all here. electioneering tells a crucial part of the story of this album regarding a borderline hostile takeover of a government whereas lift is about i think drug addiction. completely different ballparks even though i would rather listen to lift instead of electioneering at any given time. however this song is definitely the most straight up rock-and-roll song on the album but in a way that makes it generic? i also do not find the mixing to be great on this song as there are harmonies going on that are barely exposed and easy to miss even on repeated listens. this is certainly the most overtly political song this work has to offer and the most cookie-cutter in a sense but it is no way bad. i fully appreciate what it contributes to beginning the second half even though this album falls into the trap that i described on my review of in rainbows. it starts out very strong then somewhat wanes in the second and then ends on a high note to retroactively trick you into thinking every song was amazing. this song is not amazing  it is just good. a solid 35 109 listens. if there were one song that was meant to describe the entirety of ok computer it would have to be climbing up the walls. this piece perfectly captures a feeling of unease. the pitched-down drums the slow build the odd stretches of grating noises and most of all yorkes performance. i would say that this song would fall flat on its face without the vocal track being performed layered mixed and altered in the way that it is. the effect on one of yorkes voice makes him sound like a demented robot singing directly into your ears and it is unsettling as hell. since the song is supposed to be an aural representation of paranoia it works like a charm. yorkes scream at the very end of the song is absolutely flawless in its ability to convey the panic. the only knock i have against this song is that it spends a significant portion being good enough. the song is about five minute long and really only grabs me when there is a minute and a half left. of course this moment would not be as effective without the build up but i guess i am impatient because i cannot honestly say that i thoroughly enjoy this song. however it is a great song for instilling dread in the listener and a great descriptor of ok computer as a whole. despite my personal issues with it it still gets a 45 116 listens. i love no surprises. love it love it love it. perhaps it is because it reminds me more of the first half of this album than the second half. it seems much more akin to let down than it does to climbing up the walls. i adore how this song once again relishes in the curious beauty of the depressing dystopia this album so vividly paints. the song feels light and floaty but the lyrics are grim and unrelenting. the words are littered with numerous references to suicide a hyper-appreciation of what we would consider mundane and vague platitudes delivered with an absolutely hollow attitude courtesy of thom yorke. such a pretty house and such a pretty garden awakens something in me for reasons i cannot explain at all. i also highly recommend the version from the leaked minidiscs with an alternate performance pitched a half step down. i may almost prefer this version to the official released version but i acknowledge that even this half step difference somewhat destroys the delicately crafted beauty that the initial release form exudes. just a fantastic piece all around. it is a 55 597 listens. if you do not count fitter happier as a song which i do not then lucky is my least favorite part of this album. it is incredibly low energy and although this may be intentional it does not work for me here. save for it is going to be a glorious day yorke fails to arouse any significant emotions from me during this song and it feels longer than it is. perhaps i am just an idiot but i also fail to see how this song fits into the overall arc of ok computer. this songs structure and build-up is at best a poor mans climbing up the walls. it does not ruin the album not by a damn sight but it does not really add anything either. if you were going to replace any song here i would definitely say this should be the primary candidate. man of war would fit excellently and since lucky does not seem to have any bearing on the album as whole lift would substitute in here fine since it too does not relate to the rest of the songs. maybe it is too harsh but lucky is a 25 at best for me 103 listens. i have seen a lot of disdain for the tourist as a closing track for this album and i have never understood why. i think it is fantastic. a slow gloomy rock is a great note for radiohead to end on. this song makes me visualize myself driving down a long empty road at sunset. this is another great performance from yorke in my opinion as it really motivates me to wail out the chorus with him also love the rhythmic breakdown of the word idiot. each guitar solo has a huge weight that grounds the otherwise ethereal feeling of the piece. i also feel like this is a satisfying conclusion to the overall narrative of the record as it evokes imagery of a passerby in the ruins of a toppled collapsed society. as listeners we do not know what specifically led to this we get fleeting images of it in lucky but there will never be an answer. i think it is a great thematic choice rather than stating that a certain chain of events in a technology-led society will lead to its downfall radiohead postulates that it does not matter that we will always end up where the tourist describes. the length is a bit bothersome and it is certainly not the best that this album has to offer but it is still a solid to high 45 no holds barred 376 listens. this album is great. there is a reason it is the highest rated on rym there is a reason it is often hailed as the greatest album of all time. it has a very consistent narrative without it being musical theatre the songs are memorable the instrumentation is unique and it was a great commentary on the world of 1997 at the turn of the millennium. many people will never like this album many people fall in love immediately it was something of a slow burn for me personally. but i do not think my admiration for what radiohead created with this record will ever fade. if this was the time in music history that rock music started to die then this was a great sendoff. all in all ok computer is a 4.55. the first half is significantly stronger than the second half but the second half never gets irritating or unpleasant to listen to.,1
ah here we are. one of the most acclaimed rock albums of all time ok computer marks radioheads official transformation into an experimental force that would impact music forever. it is generally considered to be the most popular radiohead album amongst fans and critics. neither its popularity nor its acclaim are unwarranted. this album deserves every bit of praise it gets. ok computer hits the ground running with airbag. right from the first note you can tell this is not the same radiohead from pablo honey or the bends. gone are the days of grunge and acoustic guitar. here thom yorke sings about being born again after a car accident. we can only surmise that this track is not only about yorkes rebirth but also the rebirth of radiohead. as i have said earlier ok computer is a whole nother beast from the bands last two albums. paranoid android is an experience. the track was written after thom yorke had an unpleasant experience in a bar and the lyrics unambiguously reflect his absolute disdain for society. he is a miserable depressed individual and he makes this clear when i am king  you will be first against the wall  with your opinion  which is of no consequence at all subterranean homesick alien is another track from the perspective of someone who feels alienated from society. here rather than merely railing against society like in paranoid android yorke wishes an alien species would abduct him and take him anywhere else. he voices his complaints against a heavily electronic instrumental one of many such instrumentals throughout the album. ok computers entire atmosphere is defined by its melancholy electronic elements as the world it seeks to create is one of coldness and depression. i do not care much for exit music for a film- although it is an enjoyable track- but let down may be my personal favorite radiohead song. read this verse transport motorways and tramlines  starting and then stopping  taking off and landing  the emptiest of feelings  disappointed people clinging on to bottles  and when it comes it is so so disappointing in just six bars thom yorke manages to perfectly describe the cold robotic world depicted on the cover of the album. and over the course of the songs five minutes he gives the performance of his life. i would make the argument that the refrain leading into the final chorus is peak radiohead nowhere else on any of the previous or subsequent albums will you hear thom yorke pour such emotion into his words. his already impressive singing is backed up by the seamless transition from refrain to chorus. the first few tracks of ok computer are among radioheads best but the remainder of the album while great never quite reaches those heights again. karma police is another track where thom yorke complains about society this time calling out specific individuals e.g. a man who talks in maths and a girl with a hitler hairdo and saying that this is what you get. at the end of the song yorke reminds himself that he too could fall victim to karma and should probably stop calling for the universe to punish other people. fitter happier fits the robotic borderline-dystopian world that ok computer seeks to establish especially due to its haunting instrumental but it feels unnecessary considering that radiohead has never been a band to stuff their albums with filler. electioneering is one of the albums more political cuts and has some impressive chords throughout. climbing up the walls is arguably the strongest track on the second half of the lp strings and drums as well as the screams at the end effectively create a dark atmosphere as yorke sings about mental illness and either way you turn  i will be there  open up your skull  i will be there  climbing up the walls album closer the tourist is significant to me mainly because of the final verse hey man slow down slow down  idiot slow down slow down  hey man slow down slow down  idiot slow down slow down imagine this verse is from the perspective of someone about to get into a car accident. then remember what the opening track of the album is about. everything comes full circle. ok computer should be required listening for not just rock fans but for music lovers in general. it is not a perfect album- very few are- but it is still an excellent piece of art.,1
ok computer is almost always referred to as a perfect record. disproving this proves to be an arduous task when you take a look at the track listing. songs like paranoid android karma police no surprises and lucky would be enough to make this album more lovable and memorable than it is contemporaries but then we also get songs like airbag subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down and climbing up the walls that are like reinforcements to the more famous songs. it is easy to see why this record is one of the most beloved albums of all time. the song immediately starts with a rock-themed song giving us familiarity and comfort. after which we are launched in the jerky glitchy paranoid android. this 3 sectored song sends you on a sonic roller coaster one section containing tension one where the tension is released followed by a sombre reflection on the tension then returning to the anger of the second section. the guitar work is absolutely immaculate seeing jonny perform this live is invigorating the energy with which he performs is mesmerising. we are then slowly let down by subterranean homesick alien. this is a sonically dreamy song. the lyrics of this song describe a mans desire to leave behind the world and humanity as he seeks alien life. he sees the world from an outside perspective and through this discovers that people are uptight. he dreams about being abducted and wants to become friends with the aliens. this song is all about loneliness and isolation and seeking an alternative. when they first started to record ok computer radiohead were asked to write a song for romeo and juliet. as a result they produced exit music for a film. this is a beautiful song. it opens with just thom and an acoustic. then strings are added which brings a whole new feeling. it adds tension especially with the chords used. after we hear what sounds like children in a playground screaming. one reviewer vinyl rewind described this sound as a memory which is superbly accurate in my opinion. the last a major then fades into let down. a powerful song that addresses thoms life travelling for what felt like an endless amount of time. everything in the first verse addresses travel and the isolation that thom felt from this. this is the main theme of the song. during the bends tour they spent most of the time travelling which left thom feeling dissociated and dejected in an everchanging world. let down is thoms answer to this and in the tour for ok computer thoms isolation and burn out got worse and worse. the last a major transitions nicely into karma police. this is one of radioheads most championed and famous songs and there is little to be said about the song now. everyone knows that this song is immensely fantastic in its execution. the lack of a definitive chorus helps this song flow effortlessly. rightly so this has become a staple in radiohead live setlists usually being the last song they play as a homage to the fans. this is followed by the experimental fitter happier. this is a short monologue that lays out the flaws of modern society in a text-to-speech voice. this acts as an interval song whilst still allowing radiohead to delve deeper into their desire to express their political opinions. suddenly we are kicked back into the record with electioneering. this is ok computers political song. thom criticises the government overtop distorted guitars. the song is finished with a solo reminiscent of the bends. we are then sent straight back down with climbing up the walls. a song centred around thoms experiences whilst working in a mental hospital which definitely contextualises the song. this is easily the most harrowing and dark song on the album. the scream at the end is perfection. next we turn to no surprises another song that radiohead fans have fallen in love with. this song is like a melancholic lullaby. a suicide note wrapped in a nursery rhyme. the lyrics are a person wishing to die slowly and ignorant to their death by carbon monoxide poisoning. the line i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide. clearly show this and it definitely makes the chorus more saddening. as if the person who wrote this has disabled their smoke alarm in an effort to die bereft of the knowledge of their death. lucky was the first song written for the album. it was written for the help! album by brian eno. the music transition from the verse to the chorus is so uplifting going from a minor to a major. this makes the song so much more enticing. the fact that the last chord does not resolve is a perfect setup for the last song the tourist. this is an underlooked song in my opinion. it was barely played live. however it is one of the most emotional songs on the album. it was inspired by a man that thom saw in france rushing around trying to see every landmark possible. it highlights our desire to discover new things and the proposed importance of creating memories or the ability to say i have seen this and yet never living in the moment which is the exact point of the holiday - to get away from it all. to these people thom says hey man slow down in conclusion ok computer is an album about the isolation thom felt at the time as well as how society was being impacted by the advancement of technology. however the most important theme is loneliness. this is an album that is both sonically and lyrically rich and near-perfect. it is an essential listen.,1
ok computer was my first ever listened album of radiohead i love it especially paranoid androidkarma policelucky. as a 13? years kid these stuffs are astonishing. fuzzy solos in paranoid android madness white noise in karma police sheer sadness in no surprises... i am 23 now i still god damn love this album - it is one of the greatest album ever. but as a long time radiohead follower - i prefer their later works more as i grow up. in rainbows it still feels perfect after years and years. hail to the thief perfect combination of what in radioheads mind when putting all radioheads albums together ok computer is eclipsed by other albums of radiohead at least for me. 45,1
my film teacher once described the perfect movie as a blt. everything works together to make a perfect whole. just the right amount of everything. i am convinced that the same applies for the perfect album. and in a lot of ways ok computer is that blt. one of few sure. there are definitely a few others that are blt albums. everything working together. but ok computer i would say is one of them. later on in that class he was describing you could not add anything else or else it would throw it off. i mean it has a creamy aspect being the mayo a crunch being the lettuce a sweet aspect being the tomato and a savory aspect being the bacon. i asked him though what about avocado? because i personally enjoy avocado on a blt and he told me that you could not it would just be adding another creamy which would throw off the balance. sure a normal blt is great but i still desire something that packs more of a punch even if it does in fact throw off balance. perhaps kid a is that blt with avocado. 810,1
the radio boys craft a really rather unique experience here which gives you a good idea of why its the best album on the rym charts. my dad loves this my brothers love it even my dog likes it. its the best alt rock example there is. thom is a bit annoying and this album is without a doubt kind of bizzare to the simple bon jovi listening plebian but its positives greatly out shine any oddities is holds with it. this is the most widely likeable alternative and art rockish album you can find,1
there are really only two stages in a music listeners lifetime 1 thinking that okc is an overrated album by a website that has a massive rock boner and 2 realizing that okc actually lives up to all the hype.,1
i am not going to try to bullshit some sort of what can i say that has not been said already?? review or whatever i am just trying to get a review attached to every album i have rated on this site. this is a very solid album from a very solid if just a touch overrated band. i remember checking this out of my local library and being floored by airbags lyrics then falling in love with the album as the beeps at the end of the song fell into the delicious acoustic guitar riff of paranoid android. i think this album falls flat a few times let down is kind of boring britpop fitter happier is great but kind of throwaway electioneering is an okay rock song that sounds out of place in the albums context and i wish the album ended on lucky because a it feels more like a closer than the tourist and b the tourist has some obnoxious vocals from yorke although the microwave ping! that ends the album makes me laugh. besides these nitpicks i think this is a great album and clearly a lot of other people do too. 1 of all time though....? i do not think so. perfect for airbag commercials,1
maybe the best album of all-time...i do not know! it is an unending fight with kid a! i cannot think of an album that can be more innovative and accessiblemelodic at the same time. there was nothing like that in the pop landscape of the 90s. at a time when people began to say that everything had already be done in music ok computer proves them wrong. i do not know if it is possible considering the competition but i increasingly think that exit music is their best song. best songs airbag paranoid android exit music for a film let down karma police  lucky fav lyrics in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe i may be paranoid but not an android up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home we hope that you chock pull me out of the aircrash. pull me out of the lake. because i am your superhero. we are standing on the edge discography ranking httpsrateyourmusic.com listfredcdiscography-ranking-1-radiohead- and-thom-yorke,1
hello welcome back to episode three of the series first listen radiohead edition! radiohead is a band i never had much experience with so i decided to check out the acclaimed band for myself. so far i have enjoyed them with the bends being preferred over pablo honey by a lot now we reach the iconic ok computer an album many consider to be one of the greatest ever let us dive in and see where i stand so this album took a while to grow on me i will fully admit that. i new right away from airbag that this would be a much more challenging and demanding listen than the post grunge and small amount of art rock on the bends. however in hindsight airbag is one of my favorite songs here for sure it sets a tone of a narrator with such a unique worldview one that over the course of the album explores mainly themes of alienation that really hit home. no surprises is a beautifully haunting track that truly encompasses ok computer in a microcosm yet it truly all deserves to be heard mostly. paranoid android is an opus karma police is one of the greatest pop songs i have ever heard. lucky is like paranoid pink floyd on meth and fitter happier is my favorite piece of musique concrete some moments do not hit for me i will be honest i do not like let down much as it feels too boring to hit same for closer the tourist yet neither song could be considered bad just not for me overall this album is just truly an experience it is great. light 9.,1
however cliche this might sound ok computer is the record that got me from passively liking music to actually getting into music. i was on a boy scouts mountain biking trip and i crashed down a hill on the first day hurting my arm bad enough that i had to sit out for the trails real shame i was looking forward to those. luckily enough though this gave me time to check out this album. going from the billboard top 40 to ok computer was hard. i am under the belief that if someone consumes top 40 pop music every day for too long that it actually rewires your brain and makes it more difficult to enjoy music outside the ordinary. i am well aware of how pretentious that sounds but i experienced it first hand. it took me weeks on end to let this album click. what is funny is now that i look back on all the albums i have gotten into this is by far one of the most accessible. none of this takes away however from how mind blown i was hearing paranoid android for the first time in a tent late at night. everyone has that one band that broke the dam open for their music exploration and radiohead was that band for me. ok computer remains not only their most impressive album but one of the most impressive i have ever heard. favorite tracks- let down paranoid android airbag exit music no surprises climbing up the walls lucky karma police tourist electioneering,1
hablar de ok computer es hacer referencia a una de las obras ms magistrales de la industria una de esas obras especificas en las que el concepto de cada cancin y el lbum la produccin la letra la voz y los arreglos de los instrumentos encajan de tal forma que se obtiene un producto bastante redondo y con bastantes matices que se pueden desglosar y analizar por separado de forma muy minuciosa. lo que hace interesante a este lbum en un principio es el concepto la forma de abordar la melancola y ansiedad desde un punto de vista futurista le otorga bastante personalidad al lbum mediante letras elaboradas y conceptuales letras que sin resultar ser complejas juegan mucho con analogas y no resultan ser directas del todo del concepto del disco y la letra de sus canciones deriva la produccin y los arreglos del lbum ambos aspectos resultan ser sumamente ambiciosos por el sonido tan pulido que se consigue a lo largo de las canciones a los elaborados arreglos de guitarra elctrica en ocasiones se les aade instrumentos como la pandereta piano guitarra acstica o inclusive hasta un cencerro. al analizar el sonido que radiohead alcanzo con este disco y los instrumentos empleados es imposible no detenerse a considerar cada cancin por separado y lo que aporta a la idea general del disco airbag abre con una serie de guitarras elctricas que van variando a lo largo de la cancin y van captando diferentes momentos a travs de esta mediante un sonido variado que en ocasiones se siente hasta saturado todo esto haciendo una cancin bastante solida que culmina con arreglos digitales distorsionados que denotan cierta intensidad y experimentacin una cancin bastante llamativa de principio a fin paranoid android es sin ninguna duda la joya ms grande del disco una cancin que solo puede definirse como una obra maestra debido a su tremenda complejidad y soberbia con una estructura que vara y que va cambiando a travs de esta sin que haya altibajos y con una instrumentacin compuesta por varios niveles a la que inclusive se le incorporan armonas vocales para dividir al ltimo tramo de la cancin del resto de esta. subterranean homesick alien de igual forma resulta interesante en ella la banda juega con las notas del teclado y diversas guitarras acsticas haciendo algo impredecible los arreglos de la cancin a lo largo de esta todo ello sin descuidar la produccin al poseer arreglos de fondo exit music for a film empieza ofreciendo algo diferente una cancin ms calmada y simple que empieza con una guitarra acstica y progresa constantemente incorporando mltiples armonas vocales y sonidos experimentales let down al igual que las canciones previas del disco juega mucho con el rasgueo de la guitarra pero lo reafirma mediante un puente bastante interesante al que se le incorporan sonidos digitales de igual forma esta cancin tiene la que es posiblemente la mejor interpretacin vocal de thom yorke en el lbum al bruscamente cambiar de notas bajas a notas ms altas despus del puente cambiando del sonido melanclico y desolador a un sonido ms optimista. las primeras 5 canciones del disco se ven consolidadas con karma police una de las canciones ms reconocidas de la banda y que consigue seguir ofreciendo personalidad mediante una cancin que se va desarrollando con acordes de piano y que tiene que cerrar de forma experimental para no desentonar con el concepto del lbum lo que nos lleva a la siguiente cancin  fitter happier es una pieza la cual debe ser la ms conceptual de todo el lbum con arreglos de piano voces habladas y sonidos aleatorios distorsionados su finalidad es transmitir los esquemas sociales ya establecidos y que pueden llegar a ser una fuerte presin sobre nosotros el lbum continua con electioneering una cancin cuyo concepto se basa esencialmente en ofrecer un tipo de rock enrgico y cargado con muchas guitarras lo cual a estas alturas del lbum consigue traes frescura y ofrecer un punto de vista diferente en el disco por su sonido tan especifico. climbing up the walls mediante arreglos de cuerda su efectiva y protagonista batera aunado a excntricos arreglos a lo largo de esta constituye lo que es la cancin ms experimental del disco no surprises es una de las canciones ms solidas de este un sonido muy bien logrado por su produccin que consigue consolidar y ejecutar sublimemente ideas que ya se venan viendo en otras canciones como vienen siendo let down o karma police hasta este punto del lbum se puede observar una enorme cantidad de ideas desarrolladas especficamente en cada una de las canciones otorgando un toque de diversidad sin perder la direccin que ya se tena acabo y complementndose cada una entre estas resulta increble como la banda consigui manejar diversos conceptos llevndolos a los mejores trminos posibles en cuanto a calidad sin sacrificar la cohesin en ningn momento. una vez pasadas las primeras 10 canciones viene la primera cancin que puede parecer que desentona lucky es una cancin bastante solida y de calidad por sus arreglos de guitarra pero que llega a desentonar por lo directa que es la interesante produccin sigue presente debido a que a las guitarras se le incorporan el tipo de armonas vocales sofisticadas que ya se haban visto en canciones como exit musicfor a film adems de un sonido de fondo distorsionado que consigue aadirle algo de personalidad a la cancin en general una cancin que es bastante solida pero se pierde un poco el hilo que se vena presentando en las canciones pasadas al tener un estilo ms propio del rock alternativo que se vio mucho en los 90s el lbum finaliza con the tourist una cancin que de hecho recoge las ideas de la cancin anterior ofreciendo guitarras elctricas con un tempo ms lento y ejecutado de muy buena forma incorporando de igual forma las armonas vocales vistas en lucky y ofreciendo un solo de guitarra que se repite al culminar la cancin una pieza que se parece a lucky en concepto pero consigue separarse por la aproximacin de esta la cual se ve reflejada claramente en el progreso lento y calmado de la cancin. la lista de canciones de ok computer representa un viaje bastante completo en el cual se analizan distintos matices y se elaboran de forma profunda sin descuidar la calidad de cada elemento de estas mediante un orden bastante efectivo estas te llevan de la mano explorando las ideas de thom yorke sobre la alienacin y el futuro mltiples guitarras voces teclados experimentacin arreglos de cuerda y dems entran a la formula del disco para ofrecer aproximaciones sorpresivas de una visin bastante compleja pero a la vez clara y concisa desarrollada por la banda hasta lo ms profundo del concepto en general y reinventndose constantemente a travs del lbum empiezan trepidantemente con canciones sofisticadas y cargadas de elementos prosiguen con la misma idea ofreciendo algo diferente dependiendo de la meloda o los instrumentos empleados todo esto para finalizar y aterrizar toda su visin diluyndola un poco y plasmndola en un rock alternativo sin tantas pretensiones pero igualmente solido que ofrece una aproximacin ms directa pero que demuestra lo efectivos que son con las guitarras sin dejar de aderezar ambas canciones con arreglos experimentales. ok computer representa uno de los triunfos ms grandes en la historia de la msica uno de esos discos que encapsulan todo un concepto y ejecutan casi a la perfeccin una serie de ideas tan vasta que resulta difcil de creer la forma en que se plasman estas una visin ambiciosa una ejecucin soberbia de cada uno de los integrantes y una produccin tan buena y compleja son los principales elementos de un lbum que sin duda se encuentra entre los ms grandes de la historia.,1
this album is a really special piece of music for me considering how relevant it is to my upbringing. i have been digging away at it for well-over half a decade and grew up to bits and pieces of it since i was a kid via my dad and my cousins. there is not a whole lot of well-written music about what it is like living in a digitally consumed somewhat okay pretty much full-on dystopic hyper-industrial world. you can get a lot of edgy dance music that tries really hard to sound robotic but this is really an album that touches upon how cold and inhuman technological development digitally or otherwise has turned society at large. the music is of course brilliant and well-crafted innovative as hell too but the real sell for me is how this is the first highly acclaimed epic societal critique album that actually talks about stuff i have lived through and have been scared numbed fascinated stunned and puzzled by. as my awareness of how cold technology has turned a lot of us this album just grows on me even more. one of the rare albums that lives up to the hype.,1
in 1997 popular music and alt rock took a huge turn with the technology themed and hugely innovative ok computer there is not much to be said about this album that has not been said before. this is without a doubt the start of the 2000s alternative music burst. with a track list that is nearly a greatest hits album ok computer is an iconic record that not many albums to this day compare. the record starts with the fantastic guitar riff and jingle bells of airbag. a song that deals with thom reflecting on his near death in a car accident that was thankfully stopped by the cars airbag. the music on this is some of the most well composed with a very futuristic sound and overlapping guitar layers. the solo from johnny greenwood in the second half is melodic layered and has a creepy yet powerful feel to it. all of that is great but the ending to this song is unbelievable. it starts to break down and decompose a bit with the glitch call and response from the guitars and bass which is then followed up by thom yorkes dry descending melody that gets echoed and layered by a great string synth. the real genius of this ending is the call back to the opening riff and how it interplays and dances with thoms melody. a truly remarkable opener. that is followed up with the highly praised almost prog like paranoid android. this song rocks the house and has 3 different but equally kick ass parts and a reprise at the end my favorite part. there is not much to say about this song and although it is not really one of my most favorites off of this album i can almost get the huge appeal and why this is still one of the bands most famous songs next to creep. the rest of the track list has great contrasts with the beautiful relaxed subterranean homesick alien into the epic and chilling exist music for a film used brilliantly in the episode shut up and dance from the netflix original program black mirror. after that we get the melodic and dissociative let down. one of the more poppy songs on the record but do not let that distract you from the poetic lyrics and amazing climax of this track. then we get karma police. a piece i feel deserves all the acclaim it receives and is the bands objective best song. with some of their best lyrics we get a perfectly accessible yet powerful moving innovative and catchy as fuck track that has one of the best outrorefrains i have heard in popular music. the second half of this album i feel is not as iconic but takes a more cohesive and story like approach to the topics of the record starting off with fitter happier. an interlude that tends to get misunderstood this piece sets the mood perfectly and is criminally underrated. the closer to this album the tourist is nice and slow with an explosive chorus that makes sure this masterpiece ends on the best note it can. it ends the record off with a little ding which almost leaves this depressive concept with a bit of optimism and has a number of different meanings. the one issue with this record is the song electioneering. this is a great song and is fun to an extent but lyrically and sonically it just barely fits on this album. with the release of oknotok where we got some b sides and other songs recorded in the ok computer sessions a lot of those songs could have fit way better on the album instead of electioneering. like seriously if this album had something like lift instead of electioneering it would be perfect. favorite songs airbag exit music for a film karma police fitter happier climbing up the walls no surprises least favorite song electioneering 9.810,1

ok computer pra mim no  um lbum grandioso da banda como muitos do site colocam e sim s mais um bom lbum do rock alternativo. the bends se sim merece ser destacado. aqui no surprises  a msica que mais me cativou a ouvir novamente.,1
so while music is entirely subjective and should defer all logic somehow stupid self-proclaimed music critics seem to take to reviewing this record in an entirely logical sense. how stupid is that? at the end of the day art is about wow that major seventh chord is really complementary to that diminish fourth. hell no! it is about emotion. and this album through all its memage made me feel more emotions than most albums are capable of of. radiohead have a serious soft spot for me and that is because i have listened to all of their records hundreds of times. now my favorite tracks on this album really get to me airbag being one the greatest openers in an album ever. with that cello like distorted guitar and those incredibly recyclable lyrics in the next world war... i am born again. at the end of the day this album really is not as glorious as it sounds it features songs about someone surviving a car crash someone who is sick of his home town the recipe to be happy in the modern world and seemingly mundane shit. but the juxtaposition of these gloriously distorted vibrant and hypnotic guitars keys and percussion instruments is entirely why this album gets so much cred. on top of that listen to this album right when get up watch the sunrise and tell me this album is not a masterpiece. a perfect album by most individuals standards. the only reason why music critics knock it is because it is overrated. but music cannot be overrated because it is subjective. how can you personally overrate something you base how you like an album on how it effects you. not on how good the compositions are or the musicality that is just looking past art as a medium entirely. it defeats the purpose of creating music and listening to it. so grow a pair listen to this album all day long and gain some appreciation for the album that thom yorke dreads to tour. the album plays on the mundanity of western life in the modern day he predicts it depicts a dramatization of the issues the 21st-century would ultimately be placed with global warming i will take handshake of carbon monoxide isolation wanting more meaning in the pursuit of existing i tell i will my friends but they will never believe me they think that i have finally lost it completely,1
let down being my least favorite track on here by a long shot probably says more than any review i could write could. lucky and the tourist were unremarkable upon my first few listens but they are growing on me now even though they do not really conclude the album very well in my opinion. yeah i love fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls. they are all fantastic tracks. fight me. but yeah honestly looking at all the reviews and comments on this album and in fact all radioheads stuff makes me realize that no one agrees on anything when it comes to radiohead it is shocking. they are by far the most divisive band on this site. the naysayers call them overrated drivel with very little value and the obsessives call them the best thing since jesus christ. and let us be fair neither of these perspectives are correct. radiohead is one of the most important bands of the 90s and 00s. no matter your feelings on them their progression to straight-up experimentation from album to album is by far one of the greatest shifts in all of popular music history comparable to the beatles. and like the beatles they are consistently able to top the charts even if filled with hip hop and pop acts with every album. most advanced artistic music wishes it could be on the billboard period. radiohead live the fantasy of being quite possibly the biggest rock band releasing music anymore. on the other side of the plate radiohead often feels like they try too hard sometimes. everything they write is very serious and artsy and on most first listens to their albums they barely click at all. their progressive embracing is rightfully considered alienating and in some circles pretentious i do not use that word to describe things anymore but that is a different story. critics would gush over a mixtape of their farts. thom yorke sometimes comes off as an outspoken roger waters figure and a freak for the electronic abandoning many rock conventions and allowing for the dissolution of rock in the mainstream as a result. but man to give this album a bad score requires some type of person i would think. even from a more technical view the production here is spot on the electronic elements blending seamlessly with the real life band elements coalescing into a full soundscape that can sound delicate pretty and frail or overpowering huge and noisy. what is oddly prophetic to me is how perfect a transition this serves between the bends and kid a. the bends is this overly emotional wild child of an album with a lot of youth to say and plenty of time to say it. kid a is a frozen block or transhumanism where all that remains of that emotion is phony emulation. whereas the bends is genuine kid a is the uncanny valley and this album serves as the bridge between them. there is an insecurity here that is palpable in the anxiety certain tracks here emanate. i could best compare it to a human being transformed into a machine and fighting back in vain. and it is chilling in its acceptance of this fate by the end in some way. very good album by a very good band.,1
radioheads success was bleaking them out. the isolation was pushing their naked skin against a cold metal until they were hopelessly scared and then they shattered outwards. this was a natural defense mechanism an abstract progression which had begun to lose grip on the guitar work the strings visibly evaporating into an atmospheric fog controlled by machines plotting their conquest. during this crisis ok computer stabbed up through the ground and the people fell to their knees instantaneously worshipping it as a historical landmark frozen in the most important league of all albums ever made. we were no longer dealing with an ordinary band anymore that much was certain. make no miscalculations without this record radiohead would not be a conversation. this is still the album which all of their other albums lean upon sprouting outwards in one way or another with their own dedicated followers but everyoneart students simpleton radio listeners critical publications award ceremonies mtv execs library of congresseveryone agreed that this was a significant contribution to the very fiber of music itself. and yet... for me... it felt like the aura of devotion had outgrown the nervous system while the devotees themselves were so delirious by its fumes that you could not engage in a sober dialogue about their fucking holy artifact. please you must believe me i get it. it is ok computer. it is an insult to even call this an album. but when i listen to it i hear the restless sound of a distracted band headed somewhere else. this is a mere stopover where radiohead filled up with gas checked the map and then continued on their quest towards the boundaries of themselves. which as we all know was a territory they discovered shortly afterward...,1
ok computer is the kind of thing that so many clamour to have written about that there is no unsaid thing about it. it is a really cool inventive rock album that eschews the britpop excesses of oasis it avoids big radio hits and is the poster boy for alternative rock. at one point this really did stick out like a sore thumb. moody and self-reflective electronic-tinged art rock for people that wanted a rock album but not a rock album. radiohead found their niche with this one and frankly changed the landscape of rock music to come. there really is a before and after ok computer. arguably every even-slightly experimental rock album since ok computer can draw a thick line back to this primordial ooze of an album.,1
no se puede decir nada que no se haya dicho antes de este disco. lo nico que podra agregar son los errores que siento que tiene y aunque sean bastante ligeros no dejan de ser errores al fin y al cabo. ok computer es un lbum conceptual. decir que no es echar al cao todo lo hecho por este todo el legado que cosech ya que despus de todo este legado se basa en lo que el lbum maneja como concepto el malestar posmoderno la monotona la desolacin el consumismo es decir la vida moderna. ahora esta obra al manejar y dar a expresar un concepto no puede tener huecos conceptuales no debe romper con el hilo que crea. el primer error conceptual que ocurre es empezando el lbum. si comparamos airbag con otras canciones dentro del lbum veremos que esta rompe con el esquema. no me malinterpretes airbag me encanta creo que es una de las mejores canciones de radiohead sin embargo como concepto creo que no va en el disco. s s perfectamente que es el retrato de la fobia de thom a los coches pero carece de sustancia como para dejarte con la desolacin de un tiempo moderno no pasa a ser ms que una ancdota personal de yorke. como parntesis eso de que es una mirada irnica acerca de la tecnologa y de como esta te puede matar y salvar al mismo tiempo me parece una absurda sobre-conceptualizacin por parte del pblico. nada ms pretencioso. el segundo error es seguido paranoid android. s aunque te duela este es el mayor error dentro del lbum. rompe totalmente con el hilo. lricamente me parece malo y musicalmente tampoco me parece la joya que muchos pintan. eso de que son tres canciones en una o de que es una obra compleja que retrata mltiples estados mentales me parece pura fanfarronera. la cancin no es ms que una mezcla entre the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy y una mala experiencia de thom en un bar pero sin saber a qu llegar la letra es demasiada ambigua no me logra transmitir nada en lo absoluto y la nica frase que me llam la atencin with your opinions which are of no consequence at all fue totalmente desacreditada por thom quien dice que solo era una broma. hay que interpretar esto a la inversa de hecho es a veces mi opinin la que no tiene importancia lo cual sera lo nico sensato dentro de toda la cancin en realidad. en cuanto a musicalidad no me parece para nada malo pero para nada la joya que muchos aclaman. lo siento demasiado montono a pesar de sus cambios de secciones pues estas van de lo mismo no siento una diferencia ms all del tempo. tampoco siento un buen climax que compense los casi siete minutos el nico climax que cuenta es un solo de guitarra cual rock noventero aburridoy adems de hostigante. lo que s paranoid android hace bien es el interludio entre esta y airbag y el video musical que logra expresar todo lo que la cancin no puede. el ltimo error en ok computer no me parece error realmente exit music for a film quizs cuente con una letra melosa que choca con la temtica pero creo que esta s se presta para mltiples interpretaciones y no me parece cerrada como las anteriores. adems musicalmente es una joya una leccin de como hacer un buen outro que resuelva toda la tensin acumulada durante los primeros 250 minutos. otro parntesis electioneering para nada desentona con el disco la letra es bastante poltica como para no ser parte de okc. no s por qu la mayora desacredita esta si la segunda cancin es un electioneering pero de ms de 6 minutos jaja. lo dems lo resuelve bien pero si en algo debo hacer hincapi es en una cancin de la que no se habla mucho y es muy relegada climbing up the walls. esta y fitter happier son la eptome de la obra son los cortes que le dan la consistencia y le permiten ser la obra maestra que para muchos es. climbing up the walls lricamente es profunda y compleja retrata la demencia producto de un escape de los impulsos o demonios internos. y por si fuera poco la instrumentacin es espectacular un ambiente catico lleno de samples de emisoras una voz distorsionada y un arreglo de cuerdas que acecha la demencia del autor hasta desembocar en un grito angustiante que representa la perdida ante esos demonios su total demencia. inquietante y profunda. solo alguien obtuso considerara a paranoid android por encima de esta.,1
un tipo de msica que le pongo mucha atencin son los que tratan sobre lo gris y fra que es nuestra vida. lo alienado de nuestra existencia. la realidad vaca que llevamos. pnganle el ttulo que quieran. toda esta temtica me hace imaginar una esttica formada por muchos discos que han pasado por mis odos junto a una completa e indirecta colaboracin con el flujo del internet. me refiero a todas esas emociones y sensaciones que percibimos al pasarnos del nyc hell 300am al replica o de space is only noise a  atarash hi no tanj. s hablo de esa sensacin de extraa lluvia en la madrugada escuchada dentro de un apartamento vaco ubicado en el centro de la ciudad. o de ese vaco aterrador que a veces me produce al encontrarme inmerso en este vasto espacio digital que llamamos internet. creo que es una mierda bien jodida. de slo pensar detenidamente en las redes sociales hace que me duela la cabeza. es un concepto como la mierda no s cmo lo pudieron inventar. pero a pesar de todo lo que pueda decir de ellas sigo ah. junto a todos los dems pasamos cada da de nuestra vida dedicndole tiempo. pasamos horas y horas moldeando nuestra imagen. como creando a un maldito sim. encuentro interesante que radiohead y ok computer en particular sean como la banda y el lbum universal de nuestra generacin. es decir hicieron muy buena msica y todo pero tambin tiene su mrito que en 1997 hayan pronosticado sobre cmo iba a ser la vida en el capitalismo tardo del siglo 21. s es obvio que quizs otros autores hablaron de ello muchos aos antes de este lanzamiento pero no en la manera ni en una escala tan popular como lo hizo ok computer. lo que quiero decir es que es interesante que un disco con una tan potente temtica de alienacin sea de los ms apreciados de la generacin que ha experimentado ms tiempo dentro del internet. es el target directo. supongo que valoramos la obras que nos relatan detalladamente nuestras solitarias vivencias. por otro lado hay algo en lo que no puedo dejar de pensar. la verdad es que no encuentro tan cool haber profetizado sobre el futuro all en 1997. siento que esconde una profunda desolacin. me refiero a que s es verdad influenciaron a muchas bandas y artistas pero ustedes han sentido esa sensacin cuando dices mmh esto va a salir horrible y termina saliendo horrible? es un ajajaja lo adivin durante los siguientes 5 minutos. pero despus? depresin. son las 349 am y sinceramente me siento mal por thom yorke. su alma debe ser ese apartamento vaco ubicado en el centro de la ciudad. me pregunto si hace ejercicio 3 veces a la semana,1
this album could have been the best thing of all time. the first 6 tracks and no surprises should have been released by itself. these 8 tracks would have stood perfectly on its own. without the rest of the album bogging itself down it would have been perfect. this non existent album would be rocks magnum opus. take out tracks 7 8 9 11 and 12 and you have got yourself a 10.,1
update 1609 to credit ok computer as the best album of the 90s and perhaps of all time is somewhat if a far reaching statement. i think if anything ok computer was the best album at its right time along with many other classics. yes it is a classic both in terms of significance and musical progress and it did set the bar really high in rock. but with the bends radiohead had already set that bar high. it is just that not as many people were watching. you have to remember that ok computer was introduced by romeo  juliet so when paranoid android came out all ears were listening including america. there is no doubt this was a fantastic album and was the pop album that everyone had been waiting for for a long time since maybe u2s joshua tree. why? apart from hip hop and post grunge bullshit oasis having majorly proved to the world they were a flunk the spot was there to be taken and radiohead seized the opportunity with balls and belief probably not expecting the reaction the album has managed to generate up until now. u2 had been the biggest band in the world but with ok computer it was all over. there was a new sheriff in town. and the truth is that when i first heard paranoid android i realise how much more there was then just pop beauty. these guys were abstract deep conceptual and thematic. so not only did the music sound great it was also saying something which fit perfectly in the fear and uncertainty of the computer age. in short radiohead were taking their ideas far beyond their melodies in the bend into a modern rock vision and it paid off because the whole world was waiting for it. musically ok computer is arguably even better than kid a. the band push themselves introduce instrumental art prog and incorporate it with electronic influences. it is a real leap of faith. sometimes though it just falls short such as in the meandering let down or the nine inch nails influenced climbing up the walls. but if ok computer dies have its moments in its peaks it will leave you speechless. paranoid android is the modern day pink floyd bohemian rhapsody exit music is the perfectly crafted ballad fitter happier is post modern poetry and lucky gives wish you were here a decent run for its money. elsewhere the album dies fall in the somewhat commercial side but still excellent singles no surprises and karma police. karma police is the beatles beauty all over but not done by a try hard band like oasis. in fact it is a little bit too close to sexy sadie but that is ok because it is an instant hit. so yeah ok computer. the album that everyone raves about the number one album of the 90s and of all time fir some critics. the album was just at the right place at the right time. radiohead striked when the iron was hot and they did it with a real focused plan. from there on in they had grabbed the musical industry by the halls and the world was their command. they could literally drop shit and the world was buying it....because they had the guts of saying something to the world that not many bands could or had been able to. at that point every rockindie wanted to be radiohead sound like radiohead and follow their footsteps. coldplay muse travis hell even placebo. no one would be able to knock them off the podium. they owned rock line no other band. they turned it into their sound. period. - in hindsight it does sound like it was in its time and i have discovered many other bands around at the same time that were also doing daring things so i cannot say it is the best album if the 90s. it is a very good album but i think in terms of the actual songs and their beauty the bends is all of it and ok computer loses some if that beauty because if the bass appeal and commercialism around it. let us face it karma police is not anything new if you have heard sexy sadie climbing up the walls is very achtung baby reminiscent and let down is nothing spectacular in my opinion. but that is not what i love about ok computer it is the atmosphere and message. when tom yorke sings about bring back to save the universe from music and trite he is spot on when he screams out uptight in subterrenean homesick blues it really does sound like he is calling out the neurosis of the world and when he sings exit music it is really an apocalyptic ballad. but that is not the most touching part of the album. who would have thought a poem on existentialism narrated by a computerised vocoder would have come accross as so real so frightening and so powerful as on fitter happier which is actually just an interlude. it is that which ok computer will be always remembered for the reality of the 20th century malaise that had never ever been so apparent as the decade was ending and the cold cruel and emotionless computer age was slowly creeping in. call it a premonition a vision a prophecy but ok computer may just be the most relevant album ever made. the the world needed this.,1
ok computer is an expansive and cinematic record. albums of this ilk are often described as ambitious as if to insinuate that they aim high but do not quite succeed. ok computer is an ambitious album which completely nails what it is trying to do. it has also defined how post-production is approached by most modern rock bands. radiohead manages to be epic in a sophisticated way. bands who perform epic music like muse or kings of leon sometimes sound a little pretentious as if the audience know that the style they are performing in places more importance on the music than it actually deserves. ok computer presents itself as epic and important in a completely unpretentious way. it has been said a million times but this album really shows off the full breadth of how compelling and detailed a catchy rock record can be.,1
echoes of the bunnymen and the cure permeates throughout and penetrate just enough of the albums brooding aesthetics to add life to such a nihilistic experience. the definitive heir to dsotm. period.,1
when monster have bad day mostly because cookie stocks go down and me no get free promotional cookies in mail me loves me some good space art rock that make monster feel detached like politicians brain. one of me favorite albums is ok computer by radiohead. this album appear very popular and make people and monster happy alike. music chilled out like glass of cookie juice in refrigerator with layer of space effects like frosting flowing on topographic pastures on cookie. me love ok computer but me prefer to fantasize that title actually ok cookie because that make monster even more happy! me no get free cookie this week but me have secret stash and all this talk bout cookie make monster anxious so me eat cookie now. nom nom nom,1
i will never forget the first time i listened to this album because i hated it. nonetheless this album truly defined my own personal transition from a passive music listener to an active one. allow me to elaborate. almost immediately after my first disappointing run through this album i forced myself to listen to it again. and then again. my cousin had been preaching this band to me for years. how could he possibly be wrong? well he was not. it took me several listens for me to start really hearing the nuances of this album. by my 10th listen i was in love. indeed this album sharpened my ears to the wonderful world of nuanced  thoughtful music. none of the following bands would i appreciate if it was not for this learning experience -arcade fire -godspeed you! black emperor -the velvet underground -the national -neutral milk hotel -sigur ros,1
back when a time when online music streaming was at best in its infancy i use to grab all my brothers cds i could from his music collection next to my room. i heard a lot of hype about this band and particularly this album ok computer. i believe a few months later currently in my early 20s i went on a family holiday in 0708 up north in the uk and stopped at a premier inn  a half way house for all you not from britain and finally push play on my ipod to digested what i could of this album. i remember being not entirely won over at first until the drums on subterranean homesick alien. i remember me thinking what the hell is this and than my love affair of radiohead started to grow. as the years went by songs like karma police paranoid android and no surprises become ipod shuffle favourites of mine which would leave me to other albums and songs of radiohead i would admire just as much. the meaning to this story is that i remember where i was and how my admiration grew for such a universally and critically acclaimed band such as these guys i will always have a place in my heart those memories i will always cherish for me till the end of time. much hearts  ,1

i promise and lift are such classic radiohead songs that they make you wonder what could have been. it is good the band moved on but i am so nostalgic for that bends sound so it is nice to hear new old songs in that style that are actually fantastic. the rest of the tracks here including other new addition man of war are more moody experimental cuts with a few exceptions. polyethylene parts 1  2 pearly and palo alto are all great rock songs that sound more straightforward and vicious than radiohead were on any long-player. i am glad they released these tracks from the vault and gathered all the material here. it is very bittersweet to listen to like finding old letters from a dead friend. you know nothing can rewind the clock to make this alive again but it is good we get this glimpse at all.,1
this album will always hold a special place in my heart as it is the first indiehipster album i heard and i think it is the pinnacle of entry-level music. the base sound of colorful 90s alternative rock is accessible enough for normies to leave it on but unique enough for them to go hm interesting the production and arrangements are impeccable enough to leave those normies impressed in a visceral way. the songs are varied enough so those normies do not get bored. and the structures are interesting and complex enough that those normies will get more out of the album the more they pay attention. and even after all of these years the little normie inside me still eats up this faux-avant-garde bullshit. part of i journey through ryms top 100 albums abandoned,1
there is not much i can add that stands out from the fire-hydrant water stream of praise this album has received. however what i have always wanted to say about it is how one journalist remarked ok computer is not an easy listen. were they referring to its ironic blissful instrumentation juxtaposed to depressing lyrics in no surprises? or the uneasy but dour drag of fitter happier? i have listened to this album so many times that both songs are neither depressing nor dour. there is so much about ok computer that summarizes life even 20 years after its initial release without even using words. it does not feel dour to me. it feels wonderfully fitting in our current world but manages to make me feel hopeful. it is a statement a perfect one it is a quote in brass letters hammered to the wall in the cold museum on gloomy winters morning all lit up in its shiny glory for patrons to read. but nobody cares. they read the quote and forget about it. some read the quote and cherish and relish in it worship it pray to it every waking day. some look at it and scoff disregard it think it is hogwash.... the reality is most people do not give a shit. still the shiny brass quote of ok computer by the rock band radiohead hangs on the marble wall in the museum recognized by many disregarded by few but will go unnoticed to most people. rated as the top of rym.com! it is the best album ever made! its praise is like kanye west talking to himself walking in a hallway of mirrors. however there are the few aforementioned ones who pray to the shiny brass quote and relish in it. there is something to be said about finding something that you find special. it attaches you and never goes away. i admit that i am one of these individuals despite only listening to it every once in awhile  moving on from it. most people i have connected with in my life have never heard of it. my self-proclaimed favorite album has been shared to some of my closest friends but unfortunately for me none of them care as much for it as i do. i want to share it and wish people would love it as much as i do but perhaps it is simply not for most people the ones in the museum who walk on by not caring about the shiny quote on the wall. that is okay. i know there are plenty of others who share the love for it.,1
ok computer es considerado uno de los mejores y ms influyentes lbumes de los 90 y de la historia de la msica. la verdad es que es la fama es merecida e incluso consigui superar al notable the bends. fue innovador por su sonido influenciado por la electrnica y por las alusiones a la tecnologa y alienacin del mundo moderno el ttulo es elocuente. adems es un lbum mgico que tiene la virtud de que cuanto ms lo escuchas ms gusta e incluso gana con los a aos. cuenta con grandes singles como paranoid android karma police no surprises curioso video con thom con la cabeza en una pecera que se llena de agua y lucky aparecida antes en un lbum benfico para warchild. otras preciosidades son let down y el gran final the tourist qu bien canta!. obra puente entre el pop-rock de sus inicios y la poca ms electrnica que iniciaran con kid a. est reedicin del 20 aniversario aade un segundo cd llamado notok con ocho caras b notable polyethylene y tres buenas inditas que muestran la inspiracin de radiohead en esa poca y cuyos nombres son i promise man of war y lift las dos primeras tuvieron videoclip. como aspecto criticable no cuenta con libreto con las letras como s tena el original del 97 la cual regal. -temas destacables let down lucky karma police polyethylene parts 1  2.,1
an undeniably brilliant album that deserves all the praise it gets. ok computer is an anxious reflection of the upcoming digital age that has remained relevant to this day. there is something new to discover every listen due to all the layers and clever arrangements on this project.,1
i have to admit okc is a very good album but very overrated by critics and rym userswho are heavily influenced by critics. this album is so far from all-time best album. albums as moving pictures led zeppelin ii quadrophenia sabbath bloody sabbath close to the edge and deep purple in rock can shit all over okc but those albums are rated generally much lower here.,1
what to say about an album that has already had so much written about it? the occasion of this boxset release was certainly a surprise. such nostalgic looking-back was not something i ever expected from a band that is notoriously anal about what they do and do not release. that being said i am not complaining. this boxset is a thing of beauty. previous special editions have often irritated me. much of radioheads catalogue that i own sits apart from the rest of my collection simply for its awkwardness - newspaper albums discboxes newspaper albums 10 reissues that always felt like the object got in the way of the listening experience rather than complimenting it. novelty for its own sake. however here for the first time it feels truly justified. ok computer was the first radiohead album that i heard and fell in love with. i have very fond memories of sitting in the backseat of my parents car and begging them to play it. luckily for me they enjoyed it too. then digging into the albums impressive b-sides made me fall in love with the band itself - not just it is recorded output but its ethos and its consistency the very idea of the band itself. what band has b-sides like this? my first nascent attempt to start a band of my own in my teens began with a collective listening session during which we all shared our favourite songs. i played polyethylene. this is a b-side?! was the incredulous response. lull and how i made my millions likewise remain for me two of the bands most serene tracks. the demo quality of how i made my millions in particular still knocks me off my feet - the sound of yorkes late wife rachel unpacking shopping in the background now all the more affective. for me the best thing about this release is the white cassette. the album and its b-sides are amazing. i knew that already and having them collected together in one package is a lovely thing but now with this mysterious cassette i find myself rediscovering this band all over again. the three bonus tracks - i promise man of war and lift - are a nice touch but rightly left of the album and its singles. the live versions that have been circulating for over a decade remain unmatched. however the experience of listening to the white cassette recaptures the astonishment of my first listen to how i made my millions. the experiments and demos collected here are of an astounding quality. recognising motifs later recycled on later material is so moving to me as a long-time fan. piano motifs later heard on pulkpull revolving doors are wonderful to hear - and surprising considering this beautiful instrumental piece would become one of the bands most jarring and difficult listens. the demos of unknown songs are as strong as any other b-side from the period. the penderecki-esque violin piece that could be or perhaps is a version of a track from there will be blood. a version of climbing up the walls that at first felt to me like something from 20 jazz funk greats. this whole cassette is less a fragmentary audio-diary of the ok computer sessions and more of a sign of what was to come. kid a and amnesiac feel less like the massive stylistic shift they are made out to be now. this boxset has rekindled my love not only of ok computer but those albums and their b-sides as well. there is little else to say right now. i am writing this as i listen to the remastered album and the cassette for the first time. what strikes me is that this album feels new again. i feel 13 again. there will be others out there who are far more rigorous with their detective work identifying every fragment - i look forward to an imagined httpcitizeninsane.eu analysis of these sounds and notebooks - but speaking for myself i am ready to pour over this album all over again. it is rare that a remastered anniversary release rekindles that kind of fire. the radioheads of 1997 and 2017 have truly outdone themselves - quite literally.,1
the monotonous horror of the 21st-century world turned into sound. if only the thematicallyatmospherically unfitting electioneering were not on here it would be a masterpiece.  airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police fitter happier climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist - electioneering,1
was hast du vor 20 jahren gemacht als dieses album herausgekommen ist? - ja ist das release von radiohead jetzt vergleichbar mit 9-11 oder dem mauerfall woher soll ich das denn noch wissen? - na komm schon. gibs doch zu. - okay okay ich stand also i am saturn an der theresienhhe und da sprang mir dieses cover bei den neuerscheinungen vor die augen und gekauft habe ich dort dann aber doch different class von pulp. als dann 1998 this is hardcore von pulp rauskam war ich schon ganz aufgeregt aber als ich dann wieder i am saturn an der theresienhhe stand da stand da immer noch ok computer rum und ich hatte in der zwischenzeit natrlich nur bestes darber gehrt und in einer laune der spontaneitt nahm ich dann radiohead mit nach hause und nicht pulp und habe es niemals niemals bereut. - na geht doch. und wo warst du nun whrend des mauerfalls? - ich habe wirklich absolut keine ahnung. wahrscheinlich i am saturn an der theresienhhe wer wei das schon noch.,1
from start to finish this album pulls you into this world of 90s era paranoia about technology and politics that is still relevant today. the album starts with airbag which feels like you are crashing into the world that this album creates fitting for the subject matter of that song. each of the songs hold up to todays standards and there is not a dull moment even the fitter happier interlude with the stephen hawking computer voice commanding you to be a productive worker drone of society. my favorite track on the album is climbing up the walls with its slow and chilling atmosphere that slowly rises capturing the feeling of paranoia and anxiety. probably one of the most unsettling radiohead songs ever. overall this is an amazing album probably my favorite album of all time. 55,1
as much as it sucks to love the band in a sea of pretentious fans i cannot lie when i talk about this albums importance in getting me to listen to more art rock and electronic albums. the only kind of meh song on here is electioneering which is still pretty great. its this high on the charts for a reason. favourite song exit music for a film,1
the production and songwriting on this album are excellent. my only issue is it loses steam on the last 2 tracks and fitter happier is an obvious skipper. let down and electro engineering are simply good but that is not an issue. the rest of the album is among what i consider the best music produced in the nineties with unlimited replay value. this is truly a unique experimental work that still manages to be accessible enough so that almost everyone can enjoy. -9.310,1
an incredible record timeless in its production. even if you do not like it you have to admit its monumental influence on the rest of music after its creation.,1
although many on this site talk about this album to a more personal level by the affection of it well fuck i also decide to put it that way. first of all this goes to a completely personal view in the reasoning of why i love this album and why it is my favorite ever which what i will elaborate more on is my affection in it. this album gave some supposedly radical changes to my emotional and even auditory sense in music although i had known for a long time that there will be that style of music dark and deeper that made me remain in a repulsion towards those who presume. well they still disgust me but at least thanks to those i was able to recognize more the things they talk about that surprised me by listening to them good recommendations no doubt. but this record ok computer had come out of nowhere and i am surprised that it has still given me an extraordinary affection which then has caused me more interest in the band after that. their first song it was not airbag but paranoid android that song that surprisingly identified me to an extreme degree by the simple fact of their transition from mystery to energy to humor and even i would say melancholy but then i realized that this project in general gave me that emotion. after that it was even karma police and then no surprises. karma police gave me as a feeling of sarcasm but at the same time hopelessness while no surprises well has given me the tone of the famous depression which is the one that hits me the most throughout the project. now i can talk about the album in general it was clear that i would listen to their singles with those music videos and i must say it gave me an even more extraordinary journey than i expected. to start off i removed the year on this album with the simple fact of being very meticulous in vocals and production that i can not even notice that the era it came out. the opening track airbag a track that still makes me love the intro guitar too much plus the sound of bells in the background and then the drumming that gives great power with its produced and edited sound. thoms vocals throughout this album have given me a great thought for their emotion and expression through these 12 songs which have made me obsess even more with this album for the lyrics that unite it completely. paranoid android as i mentioned is the song that has given me a huge identity to me for the simple fact of the lyrics more than anything however in addition its instrumentation the three movements gave me a great trip to my own self with humor sarcasm anger and paranoia. subterranean homesick alien at first i had a doubt if i really liked it but then i discovered it in a very short time. i love its psychedelia in rhythm and distorted melody the calm he puts in a story that puts existentialism makes me laugh and at the same time i am interested. after that calm i have to say that exit music for a film has made me wonder more with the way of this project with its acoustic melody that gives me a greater calm but then to give more power with its tone more technological in its production makes me feel in a huge fall. i still could not believe what let down introduced me with that introduction. the melody the stress of the lyrics the desolation in those vocals made me feel more hopeless than karma police a greater effect than i really expected. karma police also said before had a more sarcastic feeling but that has kept me that emotion that gave me let down. what i love the most about the theme is the keyboard at slow pace it makes me feel even calmer. but if there is something that surprised me more it is simply with the arrival of fitter happier. the disturbing lyrics a traumatic melody and with those robotic vowels only gave me a trauma for what is said could even say that i was scared by what i was dealing with which also gave me fear of the following to my personality until then electioneering appears. you know? i can not say i was disgusted at the first time because it was one of my most favorites on the record i can understand them to be the blandest with lesser production in the rest of this trip but i love the power of their alternative rock which gives me a great energy thanks to that it showed me the feeling of motivation more than anything even if it is a political issue i love his expression in it full of desire to say it all at once. i love electioneering but even more i started to adore more this album with its next track climbing up the walls. the psychopathy in this song made me shiver especially in its production full of dementia and harassment which makes me feel like the victim of the story and the scream at the end gave me chills to have a powerful end. no surprises that theme comes from everything i heard is the one that hurts me let us just say. if let down makes me feel hopeless no surprises puts me in a downward spiral although it has never existed in my life it gives me the feeling that i have it. the song that goes towards tiredness and dissatisfaction gives great effect on one although clearly depending on your mood. this song however i prefer to hear it with the rest of the album because the trip that puts me with this theme only makes me feel even less bad to hear it. it will sound a bit terrible but in the end this is how the song made me feel the first time i heard it now it does not give me an enormous affection as mentioned above but it gives me a more pleasing love towards it for the production and lyrics. after that comes lucky which gives me a feeling much less dense a little energetic but at the same time calm and with it i feel more relieved after that great trip that has given me this record. i do not say much of this because it gives me a calmer and less hard pass. this album has given me a great feeling paranoia stress sarcasm desolation energy tranquility and above all melancholy. it has given me a great sense to my identity that makes me feel very grateful and best of all is how the tourist their last song made me see how in life anything happens. the subject is about a driver angry at traffic probably will not make sense of what makes me feel but it gives me the perspective that the event will always happen and the only thing that needs to be done to solve it is to let it happen because it will happen in another time and that is what gives us the daily life. the trip that has ok computer is what has given me a huge obsession with this album. its density in its themes with that production vocals and lyrics the concept the 12 stories presented in it is the reason why it has given me such emotion to it and that is why it is my favorite of all time. simply a beautiful album. favorite track paranoid android,1
not a lot to say here really. everyone else has explained plenty about why it is good music. all i have to add is that for me it was my very first step into a much larger world of music and as such i hold it very dear. it was my first taste of truly experimental music music that was not safe music that pushed a few boundaries. sure it may not be that wild in the grand scheme of things but before ok computer the strangest or most experimental stuff i had previously listened to would have probably been...what tame impala or sufjan stevens? so...you can see how this blew my mind. and a mind never really recovers from being blown like that.,1
the contents of this boxset are a wet dream of every single radiohead fan. never mind the remasters of the already genius alt rock record and sublime b-sides. there are three tracks that have gained a legendary notoriety status amongst people who lurked deadairspace and citizeninsane on a daily basis. the first time i saw a tweet notification of oknotok happening i screamed in my car realizing that my beloved big boots will finally be released. man of war is probably my second favorite radiohead track of all time second to only life in a glasshouse. lift is revived in all of its glory. i promise turned out to be the joy division-esque gift thom has promised us in the 90s. it is glorious. even more shocking was the tape. the cassette tape containing a big pile of 4tracks stems 2 unheard of songs early live versions and nigels musique concrete work. that is just surreal. for a person who has been obsessing over the histories and the formations of each single track in their discography this was the moment of overwhelming joy. everything was so familiar yet so different. it was like stumbling onto an old picture of yourself taken long ago that you had no recollection of. there is something magical about finding out the source for nudes title hearing the early true love waits stems that ended up as the backbone of pulkpull revolving doors a 4-track recording of the national anthem in its most rocknroll version. combine all the auditory goodies with the thoms original ideas for the tracks from his sketchbooks....countless insights into the world that was thought to be forever lost. perfect really. a complete dismantling of one of the greatest rock records ever made. thank you thom yorke and the radioheads. 1010,1
excellent musical experimentation and of course a very influential album. however because of it is political  societal commentary feels very 90s.,1
radiohead seem to occupy this perfect space between pop music and true avant-garde music without really being either. they are less experimental than they are recontextualizing pop music by incorporating moderate elements of the avant-garde thus keeping their sound interesting while still being accessible for more averagecasual listeners. i think this is what causes them to garner so much hate from snobbier music fans because diehard radiohead fans proclaim radioheads music to be avant-garde artistic masterpieces. and sure radiohead fanatics are definitely crazy but that does not mean the music is bad at all. when you combine the popexperimental fusion of the music with thom yorkes absolutely beautiful angelic singing and the poetically emotional lyrics it is easy to see why radiohead and this album in particular have the status they do. is it really the greatest album ever made? no of course not but it is very very good.,1
1. airbag when i am listening to ok computer all the way through and airbag starts up with that clear sharp lead guitar i get the same feeling of sitting in a movie theater right before the movie starts. it is a combination of anticipation and a weird feeling of comfort knowing you are about to experience something a work of art that a bunch of talented people spent a lot of time and money making all for you to lose yourself in. maybe that is a bit pretentious but the reputation of ok computer as the best album of all time along with its thematic overtones makes every listening experience a bit more elevated than what you get from your typical album. oh the song itself is great- that solo is pure rock grandeur balanced out with the dj shadow influenced distorted drumming and colin greenwoods eminently hummable bass. when the guitar soars up in the second part of the solo it is the first of many moments of the album that send chills down my spine. backtracking a bit i also love the way yorke holds off on singing the title of the song until the second verse dropping the catchphrase worthy line an airbag saved my life at the perfect moment right before he launches back into the chorus. it is one of those omg he said the title!! moments you get more often from movies adding to the cinematic flavor of the song for me anyways. also airbag gets points just for being one of the happiest radiohead songs. truly triumphant and life affirming. and then beep beep beep... 2. paranoid android the first radiohead song that showed thom and crew were weirdos instead of just telling. if you did not get it from that almost queasy guitar melody and backing rhythm section not even sure what instruments they are using to be honest yorke makes it obvious in his unborn chicken voices in my head line in the first verse. and paranoid android just gets weirder and more intense from there. i can get how the rock opera concept might sound corny to some it did to me at first but the aggressiveness sells it for me. although sometimes it can still feel like a race to the third act meltdown by far my favorite section. it is the narrator coming to his senses after letting out a torrent of anger and fear which gives the song some closure a similar thing happens on karma police. a trip of a song if you are in the right mood for it. 3. subterranean homesick alien as one of the more straightforward and almost playful songs on the album subterranean homesick alien functions as a bit of a breather in between two of the albums most melodramatic escapades. in this song spacey guitars follow yorkes narrator as he drives his towns backcountry roads wishing he would get abducted by aliens. it sounds like a cheeky concept for the band but there is an undeniably sad context that of the narrators social isolation and low self esteem. the uptight!!! of the chorus always struck me as yorke trying to force himself back into reality. like he will be alright and will not have to daydream about aliens anymore if he would just let go of the neurotic behavior holding him back. although it is not as heavy as some others there is still a general feeling of unease throughout the song. will you really be alright man? 4. exit music for a film there is always a sense of this is where shit gets real when i get to track number 4 on ok computer. the quiet dread of acoustic guitar knowing what is to come yorkes pained intimate vocal and foreboding lyrics make the first half of exit music among the most atmospheric on the album. the weird backing sample of what sounds like a distorted looped sample of a choir adds to the unease. all of this tension is of course released with philip selways perfectly timed drum fill followed in suit by colin greenwoods fuzzy bass and his brothers lead guitar with yorkes emotional wailing riding this growing wave of sound surging towards catharsis. the albums heaviest song emotionally with the lyrics being about the double suicide of two young lovers. great but not always the easiest to listen to. 5. let down so on an album where every song could function as the centerpiece on a lesser album there is no way the actual centerpiece could meet expectations or even work on a conceptual level to tie everything together right? well i have held off until song 5 to state the obvious- that all that can be said about this album has already been said and that anyone reading this has likely already heard this album many times probably and my review could not possibly offer any new analysis or insight. so we already know the magic of let down a perfectly constructed pop song following a template that would be copied by many in coming years but with none of its imitators coming even close to the heights let down ascends to. we know the feelings it inspires in us. we know the comfort the song provides from those beautifully sentimental major key guitar and keyboards and yorkes simple yet directly emotional mantras surveying the malaise and disappointment of modern life. it is that shared sense of disconnect that is hard to put words to. naturally this is a difficult concept to pull off without either sounding pretentious and losing its emotional impact or sounding too sentimental and corny yet let down strikes the perfect balance. this song has surely soundtracked many personal failures rejections losses empty feelings and useless chemical reactions be it from antidepressants or endorphins during a workout. and hopefully it has also been that badly needed pick-me-up with its silver lining mantra one day i am going to grow wings offering some perhaps knowingly naive hope but hope nonetheless. 6. karma police now that sorrow turns to bitterness on the next track perhaps the albums most well known. yorke is now calling for karma to hurry up and serve justice to those who talk in maths and don hitler hairdos.. so yeah he is being weird again but disconnect from reality is made even more palpable. this all building to the great release in the final third of the song which is not so much carefully built up to like the climaxes of exit music or climbing up the walls but more a sudden switch change of pace like on paranoid android. on a more personal note for some reason whenever i listen to this song in the gym i find it impossible not to lip-sync with that phew for a minute there i lost myself section. i have no idea why and i probably look like a twat but it is just too emotional. which also leads me to another point maybe not brought up before about this album- these songs are all great to lift weights to as they pretty much all feature progression and build up towards the most cathartic moment that emotional release that you can time your set to. in fact i would say a song like exit music is optimally designed for lifting weights since you are at rest for most of the song until the final third explosion which you would time your set to. try it out! 7. fitter happier speaking of lifting weights... well this interlude has long been considered the lowpoint of the album a useless and momentum killing dirge of a computerized voice reading off a paradigm of modern living that gets progressively weirder. it is a rare moment on the album that i feel they are trying too hard to get their point across. i mean it is short enough so as not to grate too much and i guess an interlude might be in order since the first half of this album was so emotionally draining but i wish they would have stuck an instrumental like the meeting in the aisle b-side here instead. not to suggest how to improve what is widely considered the greatest album of all time or anything... 8. electioneering the most upbeat song on the album and another one that is maybe a bit too on the nose this time with political themes but still enjoyable for its catchy chorus. and heck these lyrics are relevant today days as the president of my country is currently under an fbi investigation for his ties to russia and their hacking of our presidential election. or simply because there is too much money in politics these days to begin with. anyways a fine song that for its flaws still lends ok computer a wider context. 9. climbing up the walls my second or third favorite radiohead song right here and my favorite from ok computer. this is perhaps the sound of someone who has finally lost it completely as foreshadowed on subterranean homesick alien. the lyrics are from the perspective of a stalker and are directed towards his victim in the chilling chorus either way you turn i will be there open up your skull i will be there. the filter over yorkes vocal not unlike the one maynard james keenan used on stinkfist helps to mask his typically sweet distinctive singing voice and his high register emoting is pushed to the limit with that final scream. the buildup to that climax sees johnny greenwoods brilliant string orchestration add a layer of cinematic tension to the claustrophobia. the wailing guitar sounds like an alarm going off and those thunderous drums sound like what i imagine the hailstorm outside of the studio they were recording this song in must have sounded like. the extended comedown is also chilling sounding like something off of boards of canadas geogaddi. absolutely mental tune. maybe not always the best song to listen to for someone with a penchant for obsessively thinking about certain people but this song represents the absolute opposite end of the spectrum of madness and insanity that one sometimes becomes morbidly curious to just take a peek at yknow? like the old cliche that there is a sinister nature in all of us that thankfully is kept in check by societal norms healthy relationships etc. well here it is. a nightmare to be sure. 10. no surprises and the nightmare ends with the warm childlike tone of glockenspiel softly waking us back to our normal lives. or maybe i have just grown to associate the opening seconds of this song with waking up as i have used it as my alarm for the past year or so. like let down this song utilizes sweet major key melodies despite its lyrical content being quite depressing. this is the anthem for the emotionally vacant working class life and although yorkes lyrics are deeply sarcastic such a pretty house! such a pretty garden! they are concealing a lot of sadness and dissatisfaction the backing chant of get me outtta here!. great tune. the video is also one of my all time favorites. 11. lucky if no surprises was radioheads dark take on the beach boys then lucky is their pink floyd bid. admittedly it is more straightforward than typical progressive rock and perhaps better off for it but those psychedelic guitars and grand solo sound straight out of the 70s art rock playbook. this feels a bit airbag-lite but it does stir some of the same triumphant emotions in its second verse especially the line it is going to be.... a glooooorious day. i also love the lyric kill me sarah kill me again with love mostly because i have a soft spot for anytime an artist sings to an actual name yorke would do it again on the in rainbows b-side go slowly- oh maria.... 12. the tourist and so we reach the end of our journey through the various crises and stresses of modern life with another song centered around driving. this time it is from the perspective of someone watching a reckless driver urging them to slow down. i do not really have much to say about this song other than it has not quite grown on me like the other songs have but it is a good way to end the album. i believe i read somewhere they were originally intending to include motion picture soundtrack which had been floating around since the bends era as the final song here. well i am glad they had the sense to see it would not quite have fit on this album and especially glad they would swap the acoustic guitar for organ and harp when including it as the closer to their next album. it is probably the most beautiful thing they have ever done. but i am getting sidetracked. the tourist i guess just is not very interesting to talk about since it is relatively straightforward alt rock with more guitar lines and emotional singing from yorke. i will wrap up this monstrously long review by saying i absolutely 100 agree with ok computers reputation as the greatest album of all time. it is not favorite not my even my favorite radiohead album but it just feels bigger and more important than any other record they would do. like fuck man. this is it. they really did it.,1
i basically saw this coming because opposing a legion of contrarians i do not think this album is that overrated leave it to kid a no kidding. even the fact it is the absolute top album of this forum does not bother me a bit knowing it is a superbly well crafted creative piece of work which actually manages to please a hell lot of people from every age range musical relationship levels and genre preferences. my classical piano teacher mother loves it. my 50s ballads and motown listener father loves it who happens to hate most music after the disco era. my post-rock and indietronica listener girlfriend loves it. and do not get me started with my friends diverse tastes and their equal love for this album. personally i love it too fondly but it is not even my favorite of the year of 97. with that in mind what i am trying to say is that radiohead created one of the most likeable yet legitimate musical experience of our time. in a lot of ways ok computer was visionary mainly in its thematic commenting on technology submission and codependency the rise of both the internet and the productivity cultures  hyperconnectivity and restlessness. unfortunately as influential as it was it happened not to be accurate to say that the album was hugely decisive to the overall aesthetics of rock music. it is no wonder that radiohead came to be the definitive sound of the 90s second halfs alternative rock suppressing grunges intensity with more modern feelings such as neurosisdepression and superseding britpops optimistic glam. we cannot say that the band have not tried to present an interesting more complex path to guitar-based music than the strokes dictate almost four years later. on the other hand leaving radiohead aesthetics to less favored musicians led to what we could call a muse-effect. and nobody wants that. porcupine tree tried to take ok computers overall flare but failed for its boring souless progressive metal infusion which most curiosly ripped off rawness and emotionality from it. considering it all the band which could have grown much from radioheads influence and really did it at their prime was coldplay which did not resemble solely as a pale simulacrum of it although it really lacked the punch and inventiveness of its predecessor. perhaps this particular placement of radiohead in the lineage of guitar-based music being impactful yet not decisive present yet absent influential yet replaceable is due to the vacuum that came with kid as release and what it represented at the future of rock. i mean when the worlds biggest rock band at the time goes almost full electronic the spot is free to dispute without much of a given tendency. well without further thoughts on its historical plot we could never let an incredible album such as this left unpraised. there is really nothing more flattering about it to remind its brilliant songwriting paired with the atmospheric soundscapes of idm jazz fusion and the intentionality of progressive pop. ah and the tourist track is underrated. bye bye. my three album project year by year highlights karma police  the tourist,1
what can i say about this album that has not been said a million times already? this is such a culturally ingrained and beloved album and countless publications and critics have sung its praises and explained the cultural impact that ok computer has had on the genre of alternative rock and the world of music in general. this is one of those rare albums that lives up to the hype and 21 years later has not lost any of its impact or sounded dated at all. the themes of alienation from your fellow man due to the overabundance of technology and the dissatisfaction with society as a result of that has only grown stronger with time. this is one of those albums that seems to be a personal favorite for many not only because the music is fantastic but because they have some attachment to it because of the time of their life they heard it during or how it helped them come to terms with their alienation from society or depression. for me this album has always been cathartic as i have always felt detached from other people to some extent but this album found new meaning to me when it sort of soundtracked the beginning of the most important relationship of my life with a girl who accepted and loved me for everything i was regardless of my detachment from my fellow man. enough about my views on the cultural impact or my personal attachment to the album for now let us get to the music which is absolutely fantastic. this is a collection of 12 perfectly constructed tracks without a single lull even fitter happier works to build on the greater theme of the album as a whole. we start off with airbag a great opener that sets the stage for what is to come the guitars are almost chilly as the drums work behind them to give the album a strange and multi layered introduction. the guitar work really is something to behold right out of the gate as various layers of different guitar lines are seamlessly put on top of each other to create a great soundscape and this is only the first track. next we have what many have considered alternatives bohemian rhapsody paranoid android. this song carries on the soundscape elements of the first track at least in the first part of the song backed up by the monotonous robotic voice found in fitter happier. the mix up into the raw and explosive rif throughout the middle of the track and the subsequent winding down into a beautiful and off putting chorus in the background of thom singing about rain falling from a great height never ceases to amaze me. this is probably the most popular song on the album and for good reason it never has lost its impact even after at least 50 listens of it over all my times revisiting this album. after that track comes to a close we have the atmospheric and psychedelic subterranean homesick alien a track that sounds like floating through the great cosmic clouds of a supernova while missing home. the miles davis influence on this song is pretty clear as the whole track has undertones of jazz fusion and abstraction throughout the instrumental choices and mood that the choices leave you with. the track always gives me a sense of wonder and alienation in the same way thom talks about this alienation throughout the lyrics of the track. next we have the seminal and ever sad track exit music for a film a song made famous by its use at the end of baz luhrmanns romeo and juliet and more recently at the end of the black mirror episode shut up and dance. this track is probably the saddest and most chilling track on the entire album the chilling nature of this song is even reflected in the lyrics as thom says sing us a song to keep us warm there is such a chill such a chill. the song is gentle for the first half but still carries a strong mood into the end where the background is filled by strange sounds that brings the mood even further down until it just explodes into a even more chilling and intense crescendo of haunting emotion. it never fails to send a shiver down my spine and is the perfect ending of a song to transition into my favorite song on the album and favorite radiohead song of all time - let down i could write an entire article about why i love let down but i will keep it as short and succinct as i can. the guitars are so breathtakingly beautiful and play in different time signatures against each other as the drums drive them forward the vocals on the other hand are so beautiful and complementary to the chilling instrumental that the two go together like bread and butter this is what radiohead has always been best at in my opinion. they quickly establish a complex yet emotionally impactful mood that they can gradually work upon to perfection and reach a high that leaves you speechless and in awe of the incredible craftsmanship you have just heard. thoms lyrics reflect what it is like to be such a small insignificant human in a world of transportation people going to all kinds of places and the world moving so fast as you stand so still and the disappointment that comes from feeling separate from this infinitely complex world of individuals attempting to get places. he uses a metaphor of a bug getting crushed in the ground to extend this feeling of emptiness into the fact that our insignificance and expectations are often too sentimental for our own good and end up being worthless drivel. the end of this song after the instrumental winds down is honestly one of my favorite moments in music. the combination of the guitars coming back in in full force the building and thoms vocals soaring over the top on top of himself is absolutely gorgeous. the part where he hits that perfect falsetto always gets me despite this songs lyrics sentimental and sends wave after wave of shivers down my spine i am also not afraid to say this song has gotten me emotional more than once. overall this track is absolutely my favorite radiohead song and one of the best moments in music in the 90s and the climax of the album and the most flawless song to be the climax as well. the next few songs are great with karma police being another incredibly famous song from the album which continues the strong mood of the record. fitter happier always gives me shivers too but mostly because the mood is so disturbing and reflective of how uniform and horrifying the idea of always trying to stay happy and meet the status quo can be. we are all expected to follow all of these rules towards what makes us a good member of society when ultimately all it does is restrict us make us less individualistic and distract us from the fact that the system is fucking us all while making it seem like we benefit from it. it has a great message but sometimes i cannot really face the song as the mood it puts me in is to opposite to the one i get from the next track electioneering which is probably the best straight up rock song on the album and it always gets my blood pumping. electioneering and climbing up the walls are two great songs with great production but as songs the stick out the least to me on the tracklist because the other tracks are so standout in comparison. no surprises is another standout single from this album it contrasts the lullaby-esque quality of the instrumental and vocals versus the antagonistic and cynical lyrics about the destructive effect of our endless and demeaning jobs as the government decides everything for us. we should stand up for ourselves but in this world it is often too much to ask for people to become impassioned enough to change so we just passively deal with the cycle of a life where nothing we do matters and no one cares. a great single and transition into my second favorite track on the album lucky. lucky is a lot of things for me it is a sad dirge of a song with guitars that wail almost like they are crying and a vocal performance and lyrics that sound pretty much hopeless but it is also a song that connects me to one of the most passionate moments of my life. it was a bitter cold saturday in wisconsin despite the fact that it was mid april we had just had a huge blizzard and even though it was hugely impractical i was set on seeing the girl i had been dating. i met her on a greyhound bus and had developed such a strong bond with her that even mountains of snow in the road was not going to stop me from seeing her. we drove to the mall and listened to this album in the parking lot and during our listen we passionately made out during this track and the tourist. this girl would go on to be the first serious relationship i have had in 4 years and is my current girlfriend so lucky is our song. it is our song by circumstance but i think that the fact that this song ended up being our song is not to make a pun lucky. lucky really captures the feelings i for over a year before i met her and i felt the desolation of this tracks lyrics i just wish someone could have pulled me out of the suffering of my life and she did. the tourist is the best ending to this album that anyone could have asked for and i honestly think it is the most underrated song on the album by far. it is so hauntingly beautiful and reflective it is such a fitting ending to the album as a whole. the album started off with a bang and ends on a reflective melancholic little tune that i think captures what ok computer is about wistful reflection on the alienation of your life perfectly matched to grand yet sentimental and chilling cerebral instrumentals. ok computer is not just my favorite radiohead album it is one of my all time favorite albums to ever be released my man the fact that it is number 1 on this site makes a lot of sense as it is obvious to me that this album is most important to those who see that music can change your life that it is not just something to put on in the background. the album has rightfully been remembered by history for what it is one of the most important albums of all time a decade defining and momentous peak of what alternative rock was and still is and one of the ideals of what music can achieve. it is one of the few albums i would say is absolutely perfect and i would recommend anyone trying to get into music beyond what their friends and family listen to give this masterpiece a listen it is absolutely an essential listen for everyone.,1
i cannot add anything else to this album that everyone else has not said already. that or i am just lazy. ooo i got a new hit on my facebook page!,1
this is one of very few albums that i think has a tracklist where every song is good. it was perfect for the turn of the century and a rushing of humanity into the digital age. perfect for a solemn drive out on the road though it makes me think of car crashes. the album is beautifully sad in many ways i will not sit here and interpret all the songs though. i feel bad for anybody who cannot appreciate it. even the non-musical track fitter happier fits well into the mood of the album. amazing obviously recommended and hopefully stands the test of time. i have listened to this album at my darkest times and it is made me cry at different times throughout it and sucks the warmth from me it is cold has made me think of dying at times and yet throws you straws of life just barely to grasp to and then it loops over and over.,1
is ok computer grossly overrated? probably. is ok computer the greatest album of all time? who is to say. is ok computer still a flawless 10? yeah duh.,1
radioheads ok computer has already been examined re-examined and assessed ever since it arrived in 97. there is really not much for me to say about this album. i really like it and let down is my favorite radiohead song that they have written. is this album overrated? yes. is it still a tremendous effort in its own right? yes. do i ask myself easy questions so i sound really smart like dwight? yes. this is not an album that will amaze you on the first listen. it rewards the listener with multiple spins. great album and one of my top 3 radiohead records along with the bends and in rainbows. how i made my millions and lull are both fantastic b-sides that should be sought after!,1
mont  4. je trouve toujours quok computer ne mrite pas sa mdaille dor dans le top rym je lestime lgrement surestim et je pense que je ne le vnrerai jamais autant que bien des mlomanes. plus largement radiohead me sera probablement toujours un peu hermtique. nanmoins il y a bien une chose que je suis forc dadmettre  toutes les chansons de ce disque sont excellentes. chacune fourmille de dtails et atteint sans peine son objectif que ce soit apaiser faire svader mouvoir surprendre... il plane sur ce disque une ambiance thre tout  fait charmante. quand je lcoute jai aussi limpression dtre plong dans un nuage tout est un peu brumeux lointain froid quelque fois... mais beau assurment. je ne dtaillerai pas tous les titres mais il y aurait clairement de quoi crire des tartines. let down est sans doute lune des plus belles choses que je connaisse les fameux tubes que sont no surprises lucky karma police et le barr paranoid android quel ovni ! mritent tout  fait leur succs. plus subtiles airbag exit music et climbing up the walls sont de relles russites. jaime mme linterlude cyberntique fitter happier qui mme tout droite  un electroneering plus classique mais qui remue bien tout a. bref ce gros classique des 90s sest progressivement ouvert  moi. une belle exprience.,1

pop art pop ok computer admirado hasta la idolatra hasta el fanatismo. una obsesin para toda una generacin. una obsesin ms que merecida para el disco ms hipertrofiado de los 90. entre la hinchazn meditica que lo elev a los altares desde que sali y la hinchazn emocional por lo que ha significado para tanta gente es imposible aclararse y hacerse una idea ajustada de lo que es ok computer y hasta dnde alcanza su autenticidad. no pasa lo mismo con sus tentculos que se hunden sin ocultarlo en las profundidades de la cultura popular ya sea la ms elevada o la ms vulgar. el disco y el grupo no ocultan sus influencias. sera estpido. ah est la huella de esa gua del autoestopista galctico serie britnica que le presta sus androides paranicos y le da ttulo. ese bitches brew de miles davis que trataron de invocar en subterranean homesick alien ttulo inspirado en una de bob dylan por cierto pero que les sali ms bien the beatles. esa bohemian rhapsody queen en la que dicen haberse inspirado para los cambios de paranoid android y tantas y tantas otras referencias que hervan en la cabeza y las manos de un grupo que se muestra aqu a punto de explosionar. este era slo su tercer disco un poco pronto tal vez para derrochar la inspiracin meldica el tino expresivo y el concepto que yace en esta obra. sorprendente sobre todo cuando nos dejamos llevar y disfrutamos de la enorme cantidad de detalles que tiene que son los que lo hacen tan grande. ese bajo a medio tocar que se calla cuando no debe casi dub de airbag la guitarra rota por la distorsin que parte en dos paranoid android los melotrones aqu y all la calma suicida de exit music para la pelcula romeo  juliet de baz luhrmann el cambio meldico en karma police dos canciones en una que es capaz de hacerme levitar el piano perdido de fitter happier la distorsin radical de electioneering la parquedad terminal de climbing up the walls la meloda de caja de msica de no surprises ese we are standing on the edge que se cae de la boca agotada de thom y tantos y tantos detalles que hacen nico a este lbum y merecedor de toda su adhesin incondicional. mucho se ha hablado de su concepto y de las ideas que trata de transmitir. no es balad este tema porque tal vez esa es la clave para entender porqu ha conectado tan bien con el pblico cuando no lo olvidemos sus ventas en ee.uu. fueron subestimadas a priori. no era un disco comercial decan pero eso no import porque lo que cuenta nos llega al alma. ok computer nos habla de nosotros mismos en el difcil cambio de siglo. ataca al consumismo a la superficialidad de las relaciones a un mundo robtico que deshumaniza y aliena. todo en un disco en el que thom yorke se jactaba de que haba dejado a un lado la negatividad de su obra anterior en pos de un positivismo que no acabo de ver muy claro. ok computer tiene su sitio entre los grandes y ni ballard ni la velvet underground otras influencias fundamentales pueden explicar esto. seguro que es porque es una obra seria y slida. una de esas que se cree lo que cuenta. y se lo cree porque lo que cuenta es importante y esencial para nuestra vida. porque no es msica de fondo sino que exige toda nuestra atencin. y se la vamos a prestar siempre aunque pueda sonarnos melindroso en sus juegos meldicos y en los contrapuntos vocales del llorn de thom yorke. porque a pesar de sus imperfecciones el cabrn nos gusta hasta decir basta.,1
this is probably the last album that radiohead made where they still made obviously melodic music. ok computer lies half-way between the oddities of art rock and the accessible styles of somewhat different alt rock. compare anything on this to the following two albums and the well-explored difference is astounding. but that aside ok computer still manages to be as listenable as the bends but clearly leaning towards a less-melodic form music. ultimately it does this alt-art-rock style impeccably.,1

you do not remember! you do not remember! why do not you remember my name... to which i reply oh of course i fucking do. i will always remember the name of this masterpiece. ok computer is one of those albums where the music counts just as much as the entire experience. seriously from the front to the back there will be some sort of mood or some sort of memory you will feel or recall. starting with airbag about thom yorkes car accident when he was younger this album slowly begins to take off and pull you in. if you enjoy this band or their counterparts you will be sucked right in and enjoy the hell out of it just like me. but if you are a casual or different genre listener or a first timer you will probably be impressed with airbag slightly but will take a while to sink in. but by the last strike of jonnys guitar at the end of the song... boop boop boop boop paranoid android happens. and it happens oh it happens. this song will most definitely grab you by the hand and yank you into the world of yorke  co. this song was and still is the bohemian rhapsody of the 90s and was definitely another massive leap away from their debut. and think about all those people who say radiohead croon too much. you are wrong son! this track is most definitely one you will never forget as well as the rest of this album. the truth is paranoid android is a mixture of everything good an acoustic intro some cool basslines a guitar seizure a ballad and a balls to the wall climax. this song has everything and anything. trust me you will not find this anywhere else in alternative rock unless you are muse i am looking at you citizen erased  then the third song kicks in subterranean homesick alien which makes you feel as if you are floating or hovering above the earth. i listened to this song just before i watched some people skydive and the two just click together so well. this song is brilliant and most certainly not uptight. after this we get the first real slower and more melancholy track of the album exit music for a film. this song is just so depressingly sad and really pulls on those good old heart-strings. but in ways this song is also very mysterious and scary plus the fact it hints there is another track on the album like this climbing up the walls. the we hope that you choke line is really really deep. let down arrives afterwards and is a very bittersweet addition to what has already been a journey of a record. the bleeps and the bloops at the end of the previous song continue into karma police one of the most recognisable radiohead songs and also one of their strongest songs ever. the lyrics the melody the corruption of the synthkeyboard at the end it just all fits together perfectly and beautifully. in fact i would say it was one the strongest singles of the 90s and of all time! this corruption leads into a microsoft sam-like voice in fitter happier a computer-narrated poem about life as a human and normal things but in ways really seems quite dark. it is the bit in the album you just cannot miss. next up electioneering a bouncy smiths-like song with some very big messages underneath and yes this is rocking. it is mental and that is one of the ways i like it! but next...is a turning point. this album seems to have gone through talking scenes of society life people struggle depression and accidents but the next song you will experience is climbing up the walls which is fucking terrifying. it is such an awesome song but i would not listen to it at 2 am in the morning for fucks sake. the toys in the basement line is just very creepy and unnerving i like this song a lot for its unsettling atmopshere. and the screams at the end this may be the scariest rh song period! the somewhat nightmare song of the album is followed by a daydream and once again another heart-string puller no surprises. another instantly loveable track and a fan-favourite this song sticks out in its pure relatable-ness and its emotion. yorke is basically pretending he is saying his last goodbyes here and it is really touching. a piece of art. followed closely by lucky another song about a crash this time an air-crash the album begins to decend into its final moments. the final moment comes in the form of... the tourist.this song is so unbelievably hopeful and gorgeous in its very soothing instrumentation and powerful climax. happiness is the key to actually enjoy any part of this song. whilst i would say it is most certainly the happiest song on ok computer it is also the second strongest after paranoid android and along with it one of my favourite and instantly relatable songs of all time ever. if you have not heard this album yet go hear it now. it is choice and it will be a fantastic one you will make to do it. 55 ding,1
this is where radiohead really started to experiment. it is also the peak of radiohead but this is no insult to the other albums - in rainbows the bends and even hail to the thief are all insanely good albums even if they each have one or two flaws. ok computer on the other hand is practically flawless. now i find subterranean homesick alien to be a little weak and i am not a fan of fitter happier but even that talking piece fits perfectly within the album. there are often transitions between songs and they are very very effective. my one true critique is that lucky is the ultimate album closer. perhaps i am alone in thinking this but the song may be the best radiohead song in existence. sure it is not as gorgeous as let down as spectacular as paranoid android as gorgeous as pyramid song or as powerful as 2  2  5 but its essence is unavoidable. it is the kind of song that wakes hidden strength within. it is a motivator without being a pump-up song. it is an emotional safeguard that promises that things will be fantastic. the tourist while an incredible song is too much of a downer for lucky. i am not sure if they could just be flipped effectively but putting it somewhere else in the album would probably fix this. what makes ok computer so good exactly? like the bends the humanity of radiohead is firmly on display - but this time it is distorted. there is an electronic distortion in the mirror and our reflection seems a little lost in the chaos of life. the album moves. sometimes it is a brilliant shimmering light. sometimes it is the madness that lurks within. sometimes it is the fears that twist the things around us. there is not a resolution - not exactly. instead there is a catharsis of sorts as the music flows through your brain. ok computer has the unfortunate effect of making other incredible albums seem bad. radiohead has never matched it and probably never will but that is okay. we only truly need one ok computer and we have it.,1
i am extremely lucky to have experienced it is impact when it first released in 1997. i have never heard of this band before the received the grammys. i went straight to the nearest cd store to buy it. i did not get their music in the first listen. but this is the magic of this piece of art. the more i listen the more it grow inside me. this is an album that changed the way how i see music.,1
i have a lot of nostalgia for this album because while i was growing up my dad played this a lot. this album right here is one of the best of all time. radiohead took big risks for this. they decided to change from their normal style to add more electronic on the album. the tracks were sometimes experimental at the time this was realeased. it had a smart and cohesive theme that talked about the society that the band lived in. there were more emotions on this album abd it was more sad. i loved it. this had never been done before. it changed the band. made them explore new stuff while still being good with their audience and even bieng better than ever. every track is different and has its purpose to the album. the songs are fabulously written. this band is so smart and creative. it contains songs that will forever stay in my mind. but it is not perfect. it could be. it is so close to being perfect. but some songs have small parts that can annoy me or just be boring sometimes like the toutist and let down. but the little bit that is bad is always erased by wonderful songs such as paranoid android exit music for a film climbing up the walls and lucky. the lyrics contain more metaphors and more interesting stories than ever before. i cannot believe the time and effort that had been put in this album to make it sound this amazing beautiful and unique. simply one of the best albums of all time.,1
the heavynoisy build up on some of the opening tracks of this album may very well be an acquired taste not quite unlike oasis be here now also released 1997. the slick guitar bends and grooves on represented by electioneering and the refined jangle on no surprises and let down show where bands like the coral and the stands took their queues from listen to bill mccai and nearer than green for instance. you heard me right! forget what professional reviewers has to say about those beatle chaps it was radiohead all along their refined rhythm and rich texture are realisations of ideas crosby and mcguinn was aiming for on fifth dimension 1966 but never quite achieved. on ok computer radiohead are really bringing it all home. it is brilliant they take on all kinds of influences and still deliever a full fledged sound. radioheads ok computer is layered in production and not as easy listening as say pablo honey and it may sound strange that the peculiar short little sound collage fitter happier that features only synthesised vocals is in fact a creative high point of the album and with ok computer creativty and sincerity of purpose is what you have in abundance yes you heard me and i am 100 serious. it is all in the atmosphere and pathos i know you are still thinking of those sharp edges but put plainly they are a bit of the whole package and once you are into it you would not want to trade it for the whole world. it plays soft and clean on double vinyl too try it on headphones with the volume not too loud and you will hear many different nuances on the same songs.,1
ok computer is a triumphant musical achievement by radiohead. their third album a work consisting of a core of very solid alt-rock steeped in art and experimentation is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever made. radioheads discography has other albums i would consider flawless. it may not evoke the sheer wonder that kid a does or be as oddly comforting and transcendent as in rainbows but in terms of emotional impact catharsis and depth ok computer takes the cake. each track perfectly fits the album even fitter happier and very few other albums are able to fit this claim. this album defines the turn of the millennium. the opening track airbag sets the stage beautifully. radiohead has a way of making the first notes of their albums some of the most memorable and here is a prime example. lyrically thom yorke sets up a beginning a rebirth. the bass motif the jangle of the guitars the slightly distorted drums and the sporadic noise bursts all set the tone for the album. they expertly transition into paranoid android a six-and-a-half minute progressive epic a hallucination of grandeur comprising of several sections each with different tones tempos and time signatures while remaining cohesive. this track shows a character both fearful and angry anticipating conspiracy and lashing out against perceived threats. the fact that a band can put such a sprawling song together in such a seamless way is nothing short of spectacular. the third track subterranean homesick alien again returns with fear. a new character a marooned alien pines for his home after spending time on earth. here a theme of escapism becomes apparent. the spacious effects on the guitars are tasteful and frankly impressive. side b begins with exit music for a film starting with a few sparsely strummed chords filled with despair. tension builds as instruments are added. the climax of the song sees the bass go wild the drums kick in and a choir to back up thom in a simply heart shattering manner. escape is in sight. the songs fades back out to just the sparse guitar strumming thom and the choir. enter let down one of the most beautiful transcendent songs in existence. as thom aspires to grow wings he acknowledges that this is impossible and that he will only be crushed like a bug. the layered harmonies at the climax of the song are like the sound of redemption itself. karma police a great song about paranoia and a dire future follows. it is and instantly recognizable chord progression. then fitter happier. this interlude is often the butt of jokes but i truly believe it ties the album together. it describes what would be a logical ideal human but the voice reminds us that flaws are human. side c kicks off with electioneering a song that describes corruption and the control of the world alongside a fiery jam of a song. climbing up the walls another personal favorite describes insanity paranoia and a mind devouring itself. the outro features one of the most unique uses of strings in pop music heavily inspired by krzysztof penderecki and leaves the auditory equivalent of a smoldering bed of hot coal in its wake. no surprises the most beautiful and melodic song ever written about suicide follows. the narrator commits suicide with carbon monoxide poisoning and dies in a fit of euphoria reflected in the tone of the song. lucky and the tourist close out the album as side d which is a triumph in art. any person who has been driven to consider suicide will be especially effected by the kafkaesque world of the album but will be inspired by the music itself to live if only to attempt to create some piece of art even approaching this album in quality. the world is often drab dull depressing and spiteful but if we manage to escape the cycle of self imprisonment somehow we will find out pretty house and pretty garden. ok computer is a work of art that every musician and songwriter strives to match in power.,1
great album. some tracks are a lot stronger than others but it gets a lot of points for innovation and uniqueness. one of the most creative albums ever made. well ahead of its time. it seems like everyone has a different favorite track from this album but in my mind nothing beats paranoid android. lucky comes close though. aside from those be sure not to miss karma police or no surprises. in fact do not miss any of it. it is a highly enjoyable album that will impress most who hear it. and bonus it annoys contrarians! ,1
1 limedibagels review is the only review of the album you will ever need. case in point calling this album the best of 1997 is accurate. calling this album the best of the 90s is perfectly reasonable. calling this album the best of all time is embarrassing. 2 if you accept the above statement you may stop reading this review now. if not carry on. 3 this albums status is understandable if not deserved. it is the culmination of numerous rock electronic and jazz influences throughout the sixties seventies and eighties coming together to form a seamless whole that is at once innovative and respectful of its source material. i cannot think of a better middle ground between the worlds of eno floyd the beatles and miles davis. despite this it is not even remotely derivative and manages to bring all sorts of neat touches to these ideas that make it feel brand new. the cello in airbag playing in tandem with the electric guitar and the way the sleigh bells in the background immediately invoke winter and set the tone for the rest of the album just for one example. 4 the fact of the matter is that despite how good the album is and how talented the group is radiohead fanboys are really something huh? i cannot imagine how many of us here must have been initially turned away from radiohead by all their sniveling worshipful cronies. not saying every fan is a fanboy but seriously if you do that shit just know that you are probably ruining the band for someone. jerk. but that is nothing to do with the music is it? 5 the music is great. front to back stellar no question. absolutely stunning. lyrics are great too. production is lush and both claustrophobic and panoramic at once. bleep bloops guitars bass keyboards etc. what do you even say about this album? overanalyzed is what this is there is nothing left to pick over and dissect. and why would you want to anyways? it is real real good. really great. top 10 best albums? yep. but not the best. all the artists i mentioned before have at least one album i would put above this one on a top 10. even so it is really special is not it? last thought the tourist is incredible. people who say it is a weak closer probably think paranoid android is the highlight of the whole album. it is exactly the kind of catharsis the album needs to slow down and end on a gorgeous moving piece that ties everything neat up like a bow. also that ding does not mean shit. calm down guys.,1
why are we listening to this fucking depressing music?!? i shouted exasperated and upset hitting the stop button on my stereo with dramatic force. susan could not answer the question just like she could not unbreak my heart or continue to love me. i was 17. she was 17 and she was my first love. we were in my bedroom in my parents home one afternoon after school. the sun was beginning its descent and in the street outside other kids were enjoying the summer evening. i was not i was breaking up with my first girlfriend for the most impossible of reasons things were not working out we had grown apart. there was no resolving it. ok computer played in the background and in an effort to make a dramatic demonstration of my sadness i had a little outburst of fury and silenced it at the climax of exit music imitating some kind of hate towards it. i was oblivious at that moment to the notion that it was in fact my friend and throughout the remainder of that evening and for many weeks and years afterwards it was the only thing that made sense in a world of hormones and emotions that did not. it is ever-present throughout a mixture of strange memories from my teenage years. for a few months following our break-up susan and i continued to see each other convincing ourselves that friendship was still possible. but often we would still yearn for each other or at least i would for her and she would oblige with diminishing enthusiasm until one very sorry day she wanked me off disinterestedly on my futon with all of her clothes still on as if she was doing a favour to a dying man. we stopped seeing each other soon after that. disappointment and uncertainty crept into my consciousness with regularity and i yearned for the melancholic familiarity that ok computer offered. my dad dismissed the album as depressing music and i agreed but thinking that i was depressed rather than just a normal hormonal teenager i liked it even more for that. its world-view and outlook for the world outside seemed bleak and i liked that because at that uncertain time that is how the future seemed to me scary unmanageable and bleak. perhaps time and experience taught me differently and perhaps reshaped my opinion not only of ok computer but of life also. the moment in the final verse of let down where the two intertwining vocal parts collide and swirl into a final chorus is so unbelievably beautiful so elating that it has brought me to tears of both happiness and of regret. thoms resolution for the tragic dilemma of romeo and his juliet at the climax of exit music is so incredibly impassioned that it ripples my flesh. paranoid androids irregular rhythm explodes away into such harmonious beauty for the middle section of that song that it feels as though the powers that govern our world will one day fall at the mercy of art and truth. electioneering rocks so hard that i feel as though i could drive my car through a wall and come out unscathed. all of these little moments and more of triumph of undeniable beauty and truth have revealed themselves to me over the course of my life a life no better or no worse than anybodys as confusing as meaningless and as profound as the next mans. ok computer is my album. i was too young to claim ownership of nevermind. more so than any other record this album belonged to me. it grew with me as i grew with it it was a constant source of comfort and discovery for me and continues to give me strength to this day. so why were we listening to this fucking depressing music whilst we broke up? why did this album soundtrack the end of my first love the first taste of the bitter disappointment that life and love can bring? because nothing else could have done. nothing else was as omnipresent nor as conciliatory nor as understanding. to a man who was already besotted with music this was an inevitable ever present that would get him through the next few weeks and months. nothing ever remains the same and that can be said of ok computer but like a mother it has always remained sturdy and unconditional in its relationship with me. it has revealed new secrets as i have grown but it has never let me down. and it will never leave me.,1
ok computer is the best album of the 90s the highest ranked on rym. you might say that radiohead fans are a bunch of insistent nerds which we are fair enough but there is got to be more to it. the magical decade that started with the grunge explosion and the independent music opening to the world that later welcomed noise rock and britpop that still produces nostalgia even in some people who were barely born at the time all of that was knocked down demolished finished with ok computer. slowly but steadily it became undeniable than this level of sophisticated but accessible space rock made everything else pretty much obsolete. it was a flood. radioheads hype is still alive because of this. kid a made them what they are but nobody would have given a damn or bothered to figure out their experiments if they had not left us open-mouthed earlier. indeed there would not be any need of kid a. all the surprise the scratching heads... none of that would have mattered at all. they had to change because they knew there was no way they could duplicate this. it was either that or becoming a rock puppet. ok computer is their last epic album. here they still have the energy the ambition the confidence the rush to prove themselves of pablo honey and the bends. thom yorke sings idiot slow down because they had not stopped yet everything was going forwards as fast as they could. in fact they were going so fast it seemed the decade went by faster for them than the rest of us. they brilliantly improved their ability to intertwine three guitars on the bends and established the possibilities of filling the sound with more and more guitar. here they take it yet to another level and start messing with more stuff and electronic toys the famous radioheads layers. at its best it reaches ethereal levels of sonic landscaping. it is the kind of music that makes me say pretentious shit like that i cannot help it. still it all has a classic band feeling. the material works just as good live as they proved at glastonbury. it took various listens for me to figure out what exactly they are playing to make it work. ok computer was the first time they stepped away from what they had done before too. electioneering is the only track that would fit in their previous stuff. it could be another try to separate themselves from the creep status. if it was i would celebrate that annoying song sincerely. they finally succeeded and went from a copycat band to one that generates an awful lot of them. lucky enough the same ones that did this game changing album made another one shortly after and it was all over soon enough. thanks to that the memory of ok computer is able to stay more or less intact like some kind of summer romance. it is aging well who knows if the next generations will keep listening to it as i listened to dark side of the moon? i do not really care. good or bad it has a well deserved place in pop rock history. i have listened to this band more than any other probably even more than pink floyd and back in the day i listened to this album an unhealthy lot. is it really that good? that is the kind of question i have absolutely no interest in answering.,1
i do not really know what to say about this. it is a classic for a reason. i think the band would go onto to do bigger and better things but this is still just a really tight album. it is alt-rock perfection enough said.,1
i do not really know how to write a review for this one - there is just so much to say and i do not know how to say it. ok computer is probably the best album ever made at this point in time. it is a cathartic introspective piece of art that culminated from a group of a few dudes jamming out together. i do not think radiohead intended to have such an impact as they did. whenever i think of radiohead i think of this sound and accomplishment. it is essentially a perfect album give or take electioneering which is a good song in its own right and contextually important but an obvious sore thumb. out of the 12 songs on this album i can almost definitely say that 10 of them can rank among some of my favorite songs of all time. and funny thing - i think i might say kid a is a much more cohesive and consistent record but i just cannot picture myself placing it above ok computer. this album is beautiful and i think even the people who somewhat dislike this album can appreciate its importance and influence.,1
ok computer. even before reading this review or any other review for that matter it is safe to say you the reader already have an opinion about this album and the band that created it. it is also safe to say anything said in this review will do very little to change your opinion of it. so you might be wondering why even bother writing about it? well simple answer ok computer for me and a lot of other people is an album that has to be talked about. not only because it has grown to be one of the most influential rock records of all time but also because it holds quite a special place in my heart. cue the awwwwwwwwws. in terms of the music there is not a dull moment on this record. in its core ok computer is a rock album. you have hardy guitar riffs and chord progression scattered throughout the track listing however its ideas are not just limited to the realm of rocknroll there is a fair bit on experimentation here as well. there are a lot of unique textures that might escape your ears initially and that can partly be attributed to radioheads ingenious use of subtlety. of course there are moments when the traditional rock elements step back and let the strangeness shine. for example on subterranean homesick alien you have a tremolo-powered organ playing an elusive chord progression with jonny greenwoods effects-ridden guitar in the forefront creating a sound which literally brings aliens to mind. on paper it sounds like an overkill of effects however those two elements actually achieve an almost-perfect harmony. and therein lies ok computers greatest strength its ability to meld together ideas that seem like they do not belong together. it is traditional yet innovative. it breaks rules yet creates new rules altogether. it is paranoid about computers yet contains liberal use of electronics. and perhaps it is those conflicting ideas that make it an unappealing album to some and the greatest album ever to others.,1
what can a simple human say about this piece of heaven? just bow down and be thankful to be alive after 1997 so you could listen to it.,1
i was not originally going to write a review but considering this is the top ranked album on this whole site right now i figured i might as well put in my two cents on the subject. ok computer is decent. admittedly my experience listening to radiohead prior to listening to this album was pretty limited outside a few songs. while plenty tracks are just so-so i genuinely loved a few on here karma police fitter happier and no surprises really stood out to me. but they really helped pushed this album to have a higher rating for me. i cannot say right now how it compares against radioheads other albums but on it is own it is given me just enough reason to give the rest a shot. in short however i cannot say this is the greatest album i have ever heard. it is good and definitely worth a listen if at least once.,1
one of those bands where i can certainly recognize and appreciate their brilliance but i do not find myself wanting to visit the emotional spaces they occupy with much frequency.,1
i would not say this album is my 1 favorite of all time and a personal radiohead favorite of mine being the bends but still an album that thank god exists in its time. most albums considered the best and i agree are usually from the 60s or 70s but the 90s was still very experimental and innovative on its own terms. so for this album from 1997 is an interesting time but the right time for this classic yes classic to be released. loveless and nevermind are some of the best to say from the decade but the album ok computer stands entirely alone. it just could be the citizen kane of albums. really an album too late or way beyond its years. it is a cold blissful album but that is what makes it such a breath of fresh air. radiohead is one of those bands that everybody listens to and talks about all the time but you maybe one of those things you just really got a hold on like a tv show on a channel you do not have or a superhero movie you just do not care to see. but everyone knows ok computer and it is praised and respected for a reason. everything is anything more that great. it is a true achievement in music. why? it has great depth and meaning to it without trying too hard. it makes me ask myself what the hell is point? especially on exit music for a film. airbag is easily one of the best openers you could ask for already delivering the albums anxious and lonely theme. it is got the popular songs paranoid android and karma police but the songs that are not meant to be singles like let down or electioneering are still some of the best material from the group. it also signifys beauty whether it is the great instrumentation on subterranean homesick alien or the space rock on no surprises. even if you do not get it or it does not click with you the first time you ever hear this album you still like it and want to listen to it more. there is even a lot more of how historically significant this album is to the music frontier but that is for you to find out. it is beyond mainstream music yet it gains popularity without losing its foundation. everything on here just comes together as one. even if it is not the greatest album of all time the question we seek the answer for is what is then? this is something we can all agree on for now.,1
overrated? sure. still i clearly remember the impact this album made when it was released. in fact it was similar to though not as monumental and all-encompassing as the similarly and understandably overrated nevermind. they were both game-changing albums that seemed to perfectly voice the disillusion and alienation of the time. though this album also seemed to address the increasing prominence of technology even approaching sci-fi dystiopian future concept album territory at times. but forget all that. the point is though they did better amnesiac gets my vote for their best album even though i know i am pretty much alone on that and there were slight embellishments and variations this pretty much established the template for all radiohead albums that would follow. the schizo multipart paranoid android is still their best song and climbing up the walls karma police lucky and subterranean homesick alien are major highlights as well.,1
ok computer is one of the masterpieces of alternative rock and represents a peak that radiohead never matched. rock was not exactly a young genre in 1997 and this album was very effective in blending rock with modernity while still retaining the genres core essence and not reinventing the wheel. the individual performances composition songwriting and production are all outstanding and it is just an extremely well-crafted album in all facets. there is a lot of variety climaxes and anti-climaxes and changes in tone throughout all the different tracks and although not every song is a masterpiece they all contribute effectively to the whole. let down is the greatest song radiohead ever wrote and it is buildups and emotional impact resonates with me every time i listen. ok computers scope and ambition is part of what set it apart from the music of the time through its balance of progressive tendencies with the post-britpop and grunge alt-rock style which often rejected that kind of approach. i am not one of those people who think that forward-thinking music is inherently superior to backward-looking music but there is something really special about the way this album seems so much more modern than most of its contemporaries. a significant part of its legacy is its cultural relevance lyrically and thematically to a time period that is bringing about some of the most drastic changes to society inhuman history. it really does capture the zeitgeist of not only its time but the decades following through concepts like technology sanity alienation and political climate. it is obvious to say that this relevance will not be going away any time soon. an essential album for the 21st century even though it was released in 1997. 9.510 written on 71021,1
prior to this record radioheads discography was filled to the brim with a lot of the angsty alt rock sound that plagued most music tapping into the new brit pop scene. while i somewhat enjoyed pablo honey despite the records unpolished production and juvenile lyricism the bends was an album that pushed this phase that was not only prevalent in their music at the time but through out the entirety of the genre. ok computer however is an eloquintely arranged record that has the emotional finesse to establish a truly depressing and melancholy atmosphere particularly through thom yorkes vocal delivery see no surprises and paranoid android as prime examples. the use of electronic music also complimented the mood that this album sets which would be further developed on kid a my personal favourite radiohead record. the only issue i have with this album is the song karma police. while it is not a bad song at all the sonic impact did not have the same weight as the lyrics carried in my opinion. the piano is particularly flat sounding in this song and kind of vanillarizes the music as whole which is a disappointment as yorkes voice in this song is at it is strongest. despite that this record is almost perfect and while most may have listen to karma police and paranoid android already this is defineltely something worth listening too in it is full about three times over this an experience worth sitting through as many times as you physically can. 910,1
it is hard to justify writing yet another ok computer review in 2017 when people more articulate than me have already discussed the album to death. 2017 seems to be the year of the ok computer thinkpiece and like a proper obedient music enthausiast i have been reading them faithfully. apart from the brilliant article from the a.v. club my favorite was the rolling stones interview with the band where the members talked about their circumstances at the time that ok computer was being recorded. what interested me was how ok computers themes of technological alienation were used by thom yorke to illustrate his anxiety with being on the road without rest for such a long time and how intentional it was to express those feelings through that device. people get up too early to leave houses where they do not want to live to drive to jobs where they do not want to be in one of the most dangerous forms of transport on earth. he says. with this as a core theme of the album the songs become a lot less mysterious making articles like the radiohead prophesies how ok computer predicted the future even more laughable. we can take these songs at face value as a collection of thom yorkes experiences without needing a million thinkpieces to fully understand the implications about the 21st century that this album explores. of course the fact that i am sheepishly rejecting a hidden meaning in this way just reveals that i am embarrassed to admit that i did believe in the deeper message of ok computer and heck maybe i still do. that is fine though. you are free to interpret art however you want it would be pretty boring otherwise. and i do think that this album is worth all the hype and obsession and dissection. twenty years down the line it has a certain legacy surrounding it. i consider it a cornerstone of modern music and man i just think it is a really swell album with a lot of interesting sounds great and essential melodies and subject matter that resonated with a lot of people and still does. i feel anxious about modern life too sometimes thom. i really do.,1
i firmly believe that ok computer deserves its place at the top of the best of all time chart. it really is that good. it is certainly the best album i have heard in my life so far. but this records quality is not fully apparent at first listen. it cannot really be represented by a single track either. no surprises for example is a great song! i love it! but it does not completely floor me. it is not supposed to. in fact no surprises is all the better for its subtlety and it gains incredible potency in the context of the album as a whole. rather ok computer taken as a whole is so cutting and so powerful that it seems to practically embody the isolation and angst of living in the 21st century. there will not another album quite like this. it was at the perfect time and place doing something that has not come before and cannot be recreated. for these reasons ok computer is profoundly moving to listen to. each track hits hard and forces the listener to reflect on their space their lives and their relationships. there is despair alienation disgust fear regret and relief captured here all bottled perfectly and presented to you in a 5321 runtime. if i have one minor complaint it is with electioneering. the issue is not with the quality of the song - it is stellar - but rather with its placement on the record. between fitter happier and climbing up the walls it is an odd burst of straightforward guitar rock that seems at odds with the chilling atmosphere of the songs around it. i think it would have worked better in the first half of the record. but that is just me. so... yeah. ok computer. you should listen to it. rock albums really do not get better than this.,1

amazingly i did not like this album when i first heard it. i was heavily into hip-hop and i could not get my head around it at all. once i did radiohead became my favourite band. what can i say about this thing? i cannot find fault with it as hard as i try. paranoid android is just an incredible unique song. my favourite though is karma police. oh my gosh. what an amazing tune. thom yorks voice is magical on every track. the playing is just incredible. there is a feeling of melancholy that permeates this album but i do not get sad when i listen to it. i find that it uplifts my spirits as all great music does. i also really love exit music for a film. i get chills when i listen to it. i think that yorkes vocals are the best thing about this album. nobody sounds like him. it is just an amazing artistic achievement.,1
ok computer was them saying ok computer we will use you in the prosess of making all our music now,1
overall very emotional and an ever so slightly endearing feeling in this whole album but as well as a feel of longing and remorse throughout listening to this. i always think of this album like going to your favorite restaurant and ordering an o.k. meal. the restaurant could be a 5 star joint but you could order a 3 star meal if you feel what i am getting at. do not get me wrong it is an amazing album. i just feel it is just motioning at one specific melancholy vibe but i definitely dig this album. i first heard this album and really got into radiohead when i was around 14-15 was depressed suicidal etc. radiohead gave a kind of a crutch to lean on and say hey yeah this is how i am feeling i am really digging this tone i want to keep listening to this and not kill myself. i would not really say radiohead saved my life but i give it props on the emotional effect it has on people. 4 out of 5. love this album,1
ok computer... since i joined this site this album is on the 1 spot of our dear charts and i am one of those people who questions this high placement. but let me explain. i see many strenghts in this album thom yorkes great voice singing these melancholic songs with multilayered diverse instrumentation which creates this gripping atmosphere. the songs are mostly memorable intense and ever-evolving pieces of fine and soft alternative rock. and as a huge manson fan i dig those industrial parts fitter happier. but despite all these great things i do not think this deserves to be called the greatest album of all-time by any definition. first of all it all fells losely connected and sometimes kind of messy or bloated even within songs the constant changes can feel unnecessary or random which putted me off sometimes. so while these songs are definetely gripping they also pass by quickly without leaving a huge mark due to the sometimes confusing nature of them. secondly while this album is constantly great it also features weaker songs electioneering climbing up the walls that are not nearly as great as the huge highlights paranoid android karma police no suprises. and thirdly and most importantly i do not see much value in these songs besides mostly great background music. do not understand me wrong it is an art itself to create awesome background music but this is far from my first choice when i want to listen to music without paying much attention. and as an artsy album it lacks subtlety direction and a climax or something like that. i mean it ends so unceremoniously. in my eyes the concept just falls flat. so yeah as i see it ok computer is overrated as hell but i see greatness in this album. but the greatest album? no definetely not. for me this is just great and ambitious alternative art rock. 4 stars,1
the most overrated record of the 90s is nonetheless a great one. while there is almost nothing revolutionary in neither sound nor playing style ok computer shines in that it sums up all the things that are significant about rock music and compresses them into eleven melodic short songs which capture the paranoia and distress of the times so successfully that it is no wonder that it is become so popular.,1
i cannot really find faults in this album after about 5000 listens in almost a decade. i really did not give it enough chances in the beginning but i always had a good opinion of it. 4 stars great but not essential. for the longest time the bends was my favorite radiohead album because i could follow it on guitar and sounded achievable or whatever. black star high and dry iron lung the bends were all songs i liked before falling in love with this album. then kid a caught on with me like a storm because i think kid a as a whole is more rewarding to sit through in it is entirety than ok computer. i cannot imagine listening to morning bell without listening to idioteque first. the tracks on kid a just sort of bleed into each other and that makes that album more rewarding. however i could pick any song from ok computer and listen to it at any time. they all work out of context like singles. murmur and hatful of hollow have always been essential albums to me the guitars here have that same magic to them. we also have the electronic stuff on top of that that pushes that same familiar sound to a completely different level. if that was not enough already we have thom yorkes vocals which are very different from the bends and pretty much any other popular band from the time. i think well written lyrics can add a lot to an album but vocal melodies are more essential in the long run when you will eventually get tired of the lyrics. i cannot really pick a favorite song but electioneering is a song i skip more than others. when i am in the mood for music let down really connects with me emotionally without resorting to sappy cliches and that is quite a feat if you ask me. when let down picks things up in the latter half it turns into pure bliss in audio form the i am going to grow wings part just overloads my senses every time. live versions from years gone by are even better than the studio version in my opinion. heck i think most songs here have at least one live performance which are superior to them. as much as i love no surprises here nothing beats a 2000s live rendition of the song for me. i will not talk about the two big songs from the album. instead i think lucky and the tourist need to be mentioned more often. i love how the album winds down after electioneering. the mellower quieter passages take over. the last two tracks may sound out of place to someone looking for the kind of hooks that the singles have but they are ultimately rewarding if you give them a chance. highlights  let down paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls airbag lucky.,1
the best album in the world. so much going on but it never sounds cluttered or busy. every track is mind blowing in its own unique way this is the album all artists should aspire to make within their genre.,1
this is the number one album on the website. i thought it changed my life in middle school when i first heard it but all the same it is a little disappointing it is number one. disappointment and pride mixed up together? shame? joy? i will have each song reviewed after this but first i want to talk about the album as a whole. maybe i grew out of it or listened to it too many times but it does not hit as hard as it used to. i think it is because to have this as your favorite album you have to take yourself incredibly seriously. to listen to this work which is objectively awesome is good. but music has a personal element. and i feel like the fact that it is number one is sad because personally applying this to your life and missing it as a story and character piece is like looking at a pollock and saying wow i like this painting sometimes when i am mad i throw things at walls. i have read the ok computer reviews. people are so rabidly invested they are ruining it. we need to have a communal consensus that this album is about thom yorke and robots and quit sullying it by putting things on it and placing it on a pedestal. everybodys taking themselves way too seriously. it is like listening to whale songs and assuming they are trying to speak to you richard summers from conneticut. it is a whale. or like how every alien in movies looks humanoid. radiohead distances itself from us. with active contempt. why cannot we do the same out of love? 1. airbag- the only usage of sleighbells i have liked in a song made past 1955. it is not my favorite song on the album but it does a great job of establishing the mood and concept without betraying the emotional buildup that occurs later. it is fairly static though the only changed happening subtly in the background in a way that is well calculated and clean. - 4 stars 2. paranoid android- i really love the transition in the beginning of this song opening lyrics included. it finds a way of making words that would be hilariously dramatic to read in a teenagers notebook taken seriously by combining them with just the right amount of minutely cerebral details to the lyrics. it also finds a way to build the mood up while actually building it down and then immediately follows that with a build down that builds down. - 4 stars 3. subterranean homesick alien- i love the guitars on this song so much i cannot stand it. however the lyrics are so relatable to teenagers that it kills me a little. i feel like it is a great character song though. i mean when i was in middle school i went around thinking that i could show people the stars and the meaning of life and they would shove me away but that was really missing the beauty that is the perspective of the song. - 4 stars 4. exit music for a film- this would make pretty good exit music. it would be losing its integrity and irony of self awareness if it were though. this is also one of the only times when i have liked that choir-like effect in the back. radiohead is just so sincere and deliberate about being insincere and cold that i have to enjoy these sorts of things. plus the peak of this song is brilliant. and you can tell it knows. - 4 stars 5. let down- this song is half optimistic in a suburban sort of way. i like how this song seems to take itself a little less seriously than the others or maybe that is just the character again. - 4 stars 6. karma police- this was my favorite song for years. it sounds fascist but good fascist. i do not think i can review it without being biased towards my early pubescent self. - 5 stars 7. fitter happier- this is one of those songs that could be a poem too but it is a better song. anyways on the first few listens it hit super deep emotionally. it is one of those things that people who hate mundane things love because let us face it a good portion of it is just listing what people think about growing up if they do not want to. so it has a very specific audience. but i fit that audience back when this album was my thing. - 4 stars 8. electioneering- this song rocks a bit harder than the others less cerebral and more quick. it is more electric i guess. that does not mean it does not fit into the story. it does. it just also applies outside the story in a more than personal way so realistically he is a bit angry. - 5 stars 9. climbing up the walls- i like how the drum beat and the vocals do not match at all and that seems to make them fit perfectly. plus the production including the statics and birdlike effects really make the song. it is steady but distant. - 5 stars 10. no surprises- this song is a mix of cute and sad two things that should never normally mix but it works. i like to think that it could be exit music too but to a different sort of film. you can hear them referencing the mundane again playing to their target emotional sphere. but in character when it is second person which is good. - 4 stars 11. lucky- lucky has more of an established chorus and growth than some others on the album. they are good no doubt but minimal is radioheads thing and i feel like basing a song in one swooping message does not suit them as well as the songs made out of a bunch of small details. - 4 stars 12. the tourist- this song has a bunch of neat double meanings but i personally do not find it as enjoyable as some others where tension was higher. it is slow but without the fizzyness or depth of emotion. it is emotional it is radiohead but it holds cerebral a little too high in balance. this serves its purpose of a closer but not so much as an independent song. - 4 stars,1
the first time i checked out rym was in 2007 and the reason i kept coming back at first was entirely because ok computer was one of the top albums so i assumed the people on this site have great taste and rym has been my go-to for learning about new music ever since.,1
i might see the future but i cannot see now very clear,1
although i am a big aficionado of this album i must admit that it is a little bit overestimated. apart from paranoid android which is the greatest radioheads achievement ever most of the songs are good airbag subterranean homesick alien exit music let down karma police no surprises lucky. fitter happier in fact is not a song but it blends perfectly with the concept of this record it is an outstanding interlude. the rest three songs electioneering climbing up the walls the tourist are good filler stuff. calling this album the greatest of all time is definitely an exaggeration. a radiohead album better that all the beatles the stones the pink floyds and so on albums? come on let us get serious. the ones that claim that ok computer is the best album of all time act like high school kids when you are 16 and you listen to something interesting you think that you have listened to the best thing ever composed. a very good album nothing more nothing less.,1
and we come to the peak ok computer the one that tests your music taste overall. i do not think i have seen so much praise and acclaim in the aesthetic albums even in its opening day since sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band andor dark side of the moon. regardless radiohead are one of my front-runners while i do not think ok computer is perfect it is still pretty damn good. i might as well get through what i disfavour. this is one of the first albums i have heard in my life and with all the hype i was not disappointed but i expected a little more. most of the album is while grand their melodies are mellow but the first few songs trick you into believing there is some strident electioneering one of the other latter sorted in with the mellow music is one of the nadir tracks excluding the speech synthesis on fitter happier but the composing still feels sturdy and very metaphorical while debatably progressive if they went that farther they would probably be in the same position as muse. another is thom yorkes vocals i mentally hearing booing from a crowd but let me first acknowledgement is original the falsetto singing he produces has a lot of depth what is thaaaaatttt what is thaaaaatt while giving a boy band pop voice vibe can appeal to everyone but continuing to hear it in an entirety album loses momentum and psyche maybe intentional since it is so estranged. but as debasing as some extents the vocals are lyrically this is the most cognitive material used of mental health since pink floyd also the more homogenous they are together how they both provide hidden symbolism on background instruments that mix in well with the authentic and mechanical pieces my favourite essence is the buildup in the background vocals used in the second versus of exit music for a film and lucky as well as using their art for escapism but giving the awareness of surrealist depression and anxiety. the ideal album for the emotionally fragile. this is radioheads first concept album and reassessing the strident tone of the album there was no way in hell that they would revert to their original heavy rock and roll sound and not many famous alternative rock bands in the 90s at the time were deriving that deep music-wise. i am not sure why even yorke did not want his work with the band to be classified as art but he must have re-considered. with that said ok computer is intelligently crafted intelligently melodic and a culturally significant work of art for our generation. highlights paranoid android exit music for a film,1
okay i know there is not much i can say about this album that has not already been said. however all of the radiohead is god bullshit aside i do not care how high the rating on this site is. this is in my opinion radioheads best record. it also happens to be one of my favorite records of all time and i am glad it is not my first review. i personally believe that this album has more variety than any other radiohead record. i will talk about this track by track. airbag kicks the album off on a dark and thought-provoking note. the slow abrasive guitar strumming continues before it evens out and thom comes in with lyrics about dying in a car crash and then coming back to life. the song perfectly balances a dark topic with a beautiful melody. paranoid android was a ballsy choice for the first single. 6 minute songs with odd structures and no explosive catch chorus are rarely radio hits. i said rarely not ever but the song was still popular anyway. the song begins as hauntingly as it ends. it starts with thom begging for peace and ends with him beautifully singing god loves his children. god loves his children. how seriously yorke meant this is unclear but it leads into the final heavy guitar riff and end of the song. over all it feels more like several songs spliced together. subterranean homesick alien is where the instrumentation take the front seat for me. the opening chords and guitar work are a testament to the musicianship of jonny greenwood. his ideas are so unique that someone could tell me that the guitar was actually a synthesizer and i would buy it at least a little. conceptually based on romeo  juliet the song exit music has one of the most explosive moment on the album. the first half of the song is played by acoustic guitar with lyrics about romeo and juliet planning to run away together. it then explodes just at the boiling point of the story. we all hope you choke. chilling as fuck. i have to say let down is one of my favorite songs not just on the album but ever. it is yorkes sharpest song-writing as he talks about distant and well let down. he speaks of one day growing wings and being hysterical. the instrumentation on this song is dazzling as well. if you listen to the layers you can see why it is such a difficult song to perform live and why has seemed to vanish from radioheads live sets. the melodic floating guitar chords are give me pure eargasms. karma police opens up with a chilled out acoustic riff and piano. this continues for the first half of the song as thom sings about annoyance and frustration. a short fast drum solo creates a transition into the chorus and thom comes back in with his feathery falsetto vocals and sings about losing himself. despite its lack of thom yorkes singing and its strange robotic voice i like fitter happier. it is a short track with a nice change of pace. it is both funny and creepy. electioneering is by far the heaviest track on the album and seems like it would be a fun song to see live. johnny greenwood really when in a just fucking rock direction with it. he then brings in some some raw buzzing guitar work over the rest of the song. the drumming on this song is also catchy a hell. props to phil. and then there was climbing up the walls. this song has an awesome and paranoid chorus. thom starts singing about someone is skull opening up and climbing up the walls. the vocals are so passionate and the song ends with thom letting lose a head-splitting scream. i love the production choice on this song too. the raw recording and reverby work is trippy. the album takes a quick sharp turn with no surprises. the intrumentation resembles a lullaby. the lyrics talk about wanting a quite life free of surprises. it is so beautiful that it almost brings tear to my eye. lucky and the tourist are the perfect pair to close off this masterpiece. lucky has yorke taking a deeper tone before his voice rises up and he displays his fantastic vibrato. the slow soaring guitar creates a great layer over the chorus. the song ends somewhat abruptly and leads into the tourist which closes the album with another masterful vocal performance as thom digs into the higher parts of his range to simply say ...slow down. the melody is slow and has so many nice twists and sharp turns in the tempo. in my humble opinion this album is one of the best albums ever made. definitely top 10 for me. it was the first radiohead album i ever listened to and had a huge impact on my musical taste.,1
well....i certainly think so. so much has been said about radioheads seminal effort that saw the band move away from their britpop routes and into the melancholic atmospheric alternative rock that they are famous for that i am not quite sure what more i can add. everything about ok computer just works from the instrumentation nigel godrichs mind-blowing densely-layered production yorkes vocals the song-writing and thought-provoking lyrics that eerily predicted life in the 21st century. there is not a single weak track to speak of either. the song let down might just be my favorite song off all time. if you have not listened to this album already then change that immediately. believe me it lives up to the hype of being one of the greatest music statements ever to grace this world.,1
it brigs you up to heaven and down to the deepest darkest parts of sadness. noises guitars distortion atmosphere. easily one of my favourites.,1
year 2190 ad it was a winters afternoon when it all began. i was only 12 years old but i still remember the crash that cold impact. i told father admin to slow down but the brakes were frozen. it was hopeless. i closed my eyes and hoped that when i opened them again i would be alive. and luckily i was. i am amazed that i survived. the next thing i remembered was waking up in the hospital the machines beeping ever so steadily. that is when the medication started. every child has to start it when they become a teenager. yet even though i was physically alive emotionally i felt that from that moment on i would be better off dead. months turn to years and my emotional numbness began to become normal. i started to fit in with the machines as much as i hated to. dropping out did not make matters much better as much as i thought it would. summer arrives. i am 19 now. i decided to sneak up on the roof one night and go stargazing with my little brother fantasizing about other worlds beyond our own. he asks if we could play hide and seek in the woods just like old times since our admins were sleeping. i agree and we jump off the roof and run into the forest together. it seemed like we laughed and ran around the woods that night forever. that was the last night i would see my brother again. the next day after waking from my sleep i began packing my bags. i looked back once more at the place i grew up in and started walking. but walking turned to running. i stopped at a small coffee shop on my way back. something about it seemed welcoming to me almost innocent. the soft music relaxing atmosphere pleasant design happiness. like a utopia separate from the rest of my cold world. i take a sip of coffee and start talking to a young girl there breathtakingly beautiful. i was surprised to find a human there. her name was belle. she was a time traveler from earth and said she could tell i was different. she held her hand out to me. just from her touch the medication i would been forced to take for half of my life begins to wear off. and once it does i begin to feel again. i was no longer numb. the sunlight warmed my heart again and a simple smile made me smile again too. i would become human once more. i was free. the darkness and bleak memories come back to me but so does the light. because maybe that is what makes us different from the machines. what makes us human is to be able to feel something whether joyful or sad. i would not give it up for anything on earth.,1
to sum it up as concisely as possible so as to avoid wasting anyone elses time with yet another ok computer review hey. that is pretty good i feel it would be an unnecessary waste of both your time and mine to publish yet another stereotypical review for this album we should all negate prattling on needlessly about an album that has unquestionably had its fair share of tired prattling as well as a healthy amount of deserving praise. after all there is already a litany of far more interesting and compelling reviews of this album for you to read many of which were written decades ago many of which summed up an album that was groundbreaking for it is time but cannot seem to outlive its own omnipresent shadow. to sum up ok computer the best way i know how it is absolutely not the best album of all time despite what the rym charts may say though to be perfectly fair who the fuck am i or any other person to say what the g r e a t e s t album of all time is. i do not think you can objectively proclaim that such an objective point of contention actually exists. second point to make this album gets a lot of love but in receiving such a staggering amount of love and adoration it has also likewise received a lot of hate. it seems to be one of those albums that has become a victim of being hip to hate on so to speak. i have had several discussions with people who hated this album but their only real argument and conviction for hating it was the fact that it is so ridiculously beloved. my main point here is that i think that ok computer is unquestionably a very good perhaps even great album though i do not think a perfect one that is still a very good album despite how increasingly popular it has become to not like it. third and final point this is not the radiohead album nor is it in my personal opinion the best radiohead album. i would give that honor to kid a any day of the week and would make a case that in rainbows is even a better album as a whole. to me kid a was the real moment of genius for this group. that is the album where all of the ideas that the band introduced and grappled with on this album truly blossomed into something bigger than themselves. many of the instruments and new technologies brought into the fold on this album did not see their full potential showcased until kid a. that is it. i certainly do not want to spend anymore time writing ad nauseam about an album that better minds have already dissected well enough and more pretentious minds have tried to piece together the secret truths of the universe by means of.,1
feels weird to review this. i kind of doubt i have anything new to say but i guess i want to talk about this. i think paranoid android is a permanent taint on this album. it is just not a good song for the most part. the first little bit and the last little bit are not bad though. every other song on here is pure quality though even the songs i first thought were just album tracks or filler like lucky electioneering or the god of all interludes fitter happier are so much more than that. i do not really like that i like this so much mostly because of how easy it is to like radiohead. every white boy on earth thinks radiohead is the best even people who is other favourite acts are flume and deadmau5. annoying. why cannot this be only ok?,1
his head was a mess full of thoughts full of hopes and dreams. he tried to gather every single piece of valuable information from the guy telling him what to do because he was certainly not falling blindly into his trap. oh yeah he would fall into his trap but it would certainly not happen without him first taking every possible precaution. he felt ready but at the same time completely clueless what was he to expect? everyone he had spoken to every author he had ever read every tv-show they all agreed on the fact that this was a great thing. but he just could not figure it out not for the life of him it was such a mystery to him how could it be? his friends turned his back on him they did not have time for this kind of hesitation just go through with it they said it is definitely worth it. he was getting closer he had taken the first step. he found himself in a building filled with sound a strange sound a sound he recognized but could not place it. his friend was with him he looked at him with half eagerness half disappointment. he pointed him in a direction he could not quite understand what his friend was trying to tell him but he followed him. here his friend said and handed him a plastic square of confusion. is this it? he asked his friend and was met with an expression he had seen many times before a look of anger and resignation. take it or leave it i am done with this stupid game. the friend exit the building he was left on his own. he felt hopeless cmon he said to himself it is just a plastic square ffs. he was holding it in his hand flipped it over discovered some numbers and words flipped it back again. he could not quite understand it but took it with him anyway it was time. he came across another human being. he was intimidating. long hair tattooed forearms kind of muscular but not an athlete. he gave him the plastic square the tattooed man looked at it put it down and went through some drawers located behind him. he came back with a circle of plastic and then for some reason placed the circle inside the square. a circle inside a square? what is this? suddenly he was at home with the plastic square in hand. what to do? he entered his room walking past what he thought was his mother and some other people sitting there like mummies staring at him. he was in he was safe it was only him and the plastic square. then he felt lost again what to do? he wandered aimlessly around his room with the plastic square squeezed firmly in his hand. his head was filled with questions but no answer was given. but suddenly as he was squeezing the plastic square harder and harder he heard a click. he was startled but kept it together. the square had opened and the plastic circle was revealed. it was back what was it? he took it out held it in his hand baffled and curious. he looked around his room what to do? then in the corner he saw the machine. the machine his father had bought him for christmas. he went over no way he thought but went on to push the obvious button the button who was staring at him. out came a tray he was again startled but kept his composure. he looked at the tray formed with a circle around a needle or laser of some kind. he thought twice but finally took the plastic circle and placed it on the tray. it fit! he gave it a little push and it went back inside the machine. was it lost? did he complete the task? he stood there for a while did not quite understand and was about to leave the room. then the machine started to play what is this?. he stared at the machine in amazement the sounds got clearer. he was mesmerized he could not move. he locked the door threw himself on the bed and stared out the window on the world outside. still kisses with saliva the machine said he smiled. even thought people had knocked on the door yelled at him trying to make contact he did not respond. he did not leave his room that day and people have said that the guy who came out was not the same guy going in. no one could quite understand but he was no longer the same person. something had happened something had completely altered the turn of the tide. who was he? was he the friend? was he the son? was he the brother? the customer? the classmate? the odd looking fellow? no he was no longer any of those things. he had become the tourist.,1
here is an extensive list of all the other albums which sound like this one and have the same haunting sense of disconnection and alienation,1
ok computer is probably the first rock album of the 21st century wierdly enough it was released in 1997.,1
i could write a book about this album but i would just be repeating what everyone else has said before me this is probably the best album ever made. go listen to it its incredible.,1

this is the best album of the 1990s. 5 stars for the creativity alone.,1
sorry. i just did not like it. edit goddamn this album does not make things easy. it is usually very easy for me to tell the quality of an album in the first three five eight listens. not ok computer oh no shit cannot be that simple. every musical direction they go in is so subtle. most of the songs on this album are the musical equivalent of sneaking an elephant into a conference room. how they actually manage to pull it off is beyond me. anyway pretty legit album. sorry for the harsh criticism.,1
i find myself listening more to radioheads more electronic experimental post-ok computer output but there is no denying how ridiculously solid okc is as far as guitar-based alt-rock goes. it all sort of exactly achieves its purpose like how opening airbag feels like a welcome to an epic space odyssey. paranoid android arguably the albums magnum opus takes bohemian rhapsody a superficial and tired comparison but whatevs into the age of machines alienation and well paranoia. subterranean homesick alien might have the most beautiful lyrics of the album up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets  i wish that they would swoop down in a country lane late at night when i am driving take me on board their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it i would tell all my friends but they would never believe me they would think that i would finally lost it completely i would show them the stars and the meaning of life they would shut me away but i would be all right the following exit music for a film is on the other hand my favorite song musically featuring thom yorkes creepily intimate voice and a climax out of this world. karma police is a sad ballad drawing inspiration from orwell andor kafka. fitter happier one of the songs i relate to the most inhumanly lists the demands on humans not drinking too much regular exercise an empowered and informed member of society while stipulating that we should still cry at a good film though not in public and kiss with saliva. after that downer ensues the albums banger the absolutely raging electioneering. the tourist is as perfect a closer as airbag was an opener. i also think its breezy ambient feel slightly foreshadows the radical transition radiohead did with kid a even if i would never have been able to predict it ex ante.,1
surely there is no-one left who loves rock music who has not got this in their record collection? on the off-chance there is and they are reading this then buy it now. sell your clothes your house and your mother if you have to. ok computer is a masterpiece it sounded years ahead of its time on its release and still sounds ahead of its time now. songs have perfect melody and structure and are produced superbly. airbag opens up the album and sets a standard that rarely slips. layer on layer of sounds guitars electronic blips and beeps. then we have the tour de force of the album in paranoid android its one song but seems to have 3 songs within it it broods along before coming to an explosive climax. this is what rock music should be it moves you it speaks to you. the thing that always hangs in the back of your mind with this album though is just how unique it sounds. this is not four spotty teens in their garage at home thrashing out rock songs these are wonderfully constructed tunes almost oddities in a world that was churning out the same old same old. only the strange addition of fitterhappier feels wrong. the songs are so lush and so lavish you feel like you could lose yourself in them. no surprises is like a childs song played on a xylophone it should be too twee throwaway but it s one of the strongest songs on the album. nothing sounds likes this fifteen years on. no-one has even tried to copy their formula how could they? it is like trying to copy coca-cola you could try but it would not taste the same. buy it lose yourself in it. albums like this come along once in a blue moon. staggering.,1
as almost everyone does i have a story related to this album. if you would like to skip straight to the album analysis skip down to the dotted lines otherwise enjoy! i used to skulk on music forums early on in high-school fairly regularly. one album that i could not seem to escape seeing was radioheads ok computer. i decided that i needed to buy it and see if all the hype and attention was warranted. not long after i made that promise to myself i received word that my uncle had died. he did not die in a normal way though he died by falling into a river and drowning. he was drunk that day and he had a history of severe alcoholism and drug addiction. shortly after his death i accompanied my family to his old apartment to help clean out his belongings. the man did not have anyone close to him other than siblings and nephews. like me as we were cleaning out his apartment i noticed he had a fairly big music collection. i was free to choose what i wanted and take as i see fit. it is a weird experience taking from someone elses music collection and adding to your own it feels like you are taking something that meant a lot to someone and making it part of yourself. i listen to albums with the possibility in my head that it may perhaps be a transcendent experience that could not only make you see life differently but also to encapsulate you into a world that the artist has so meticulously developed and created. ok computer is one of the albums that has shaped me to think this way. so by this logic each album is a story or a capsule of force that enriches your life. by taking my late uncles albums they metaphorically gained a new life a rebirth if you will by the happenstance of a new owner. i did not receive ok computer from my uncles collection though. as i headed out with my mom to run a few errands that same day i decided that day was the day i would buy the album. i did just that at one store and when we got back in the car i put the cd in immediately. let us just say that in 9th grade i was not ready for what this album represented and what it entailed. i distinctly remember putting the album back on the shelf after a few nonsuccessive listens but something kept drawing me back to it. in 10th grade i returned to it with a determination to see and understand the album because i knew i had to be missing something. seemingly it became my sole mission in life to listen to this album. after literally 16 listens it finally clicked for me that year. i did not fully understand it yet but i felt like i had finally gain the key to the locked door of understanding. and so that is how it was for a while i continuously listened to this album throughout the rest of my high school career. although not so much my senior year the album actually inspired me and incited ideas for the topic of my junior theme. due to this album i wrote a 15 page thesis on the dehumanization of society through modern technology. it was an ambitious topic for a kid in 11th grade but i was determined to write a quality paper on this topic. in the same way that ok computer gave understanding to me i wanted to give understanding to my teachers and my peers. i guess i must have succeeded because not only did i receive the highest marks for the paper in the class but i also won a scholarship with it. mission accomplished? maybe...but maybe not. here i am now in my first year of college and i still find myself returning to this album. some have called it the dark side of the moon for our generation and others have called it the most important album during the coming of the 21st century. others yet said it defined and represented the oncoming digital culture filled with personal phones and social networking. i suppose i will cut the personal stories out and get into this album and what it represents to me. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the album starts off with the broodingly aggressive and gloomy airbag. those screeching and unsettling guitar riffs kick off the trip that is radioheads third album. it is a song about a near-death experience in a car that thom yorke was in. as the vehicle crashed seemingly dooming the narrator to silence forever the airbag in the car popped out and saved his life. so just as technology was about to be the death of a man another piece of technology saved him. this sets up an interesting and important dichotomy that extensively defines the ideas of this album. i have heard paranoid android described as the modern bohemian rhapsody and that description does not even do this song justice. i have always viewed the song and its multitude of time signature changes as a concept of disillusionment from society and a jaded view of societys reliance on material possessions to find contentment and happiness. the progressions and climax of this song root it as one of the greatest songs radiohead has ever put to tape. subterranean homesick alien is a small little piece about isolation and cynicism. the singer cannot seem to relate to anyone around him on any significant level. this cynicism leads him to wishes to be swooped up by aliens so he can see the world from the equivalent distance that he feels emotionally detached from it. an unsettling and relate-able piece. exit music for a film is easily one of the most haunting songs radiohead has recorded. i have always viewed it in a particular way. judging from its placement on the album i have always thought that it had a lot to do with the previous track. although yorke felt detached from society he finally found a girl who was just like him someone he could relate very closely to. it turns out that love was not the remedy for their problems in fact they only added to the collective depression. together they had come up with a scheme to kill themselves perhaps from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car. that is what this song is about to me. this girl remains an important plot point as the album progresses. let down is easily one of the most beautiful and transcendent pieces radiohead has ever produced. the song seems to take place after a time gap from the suicide attempt in the last song. we can assume the narrator no longer sees this girl maybe her father found out like yorke thought and their suicide attempt was unsuccessful. another interesting theory is that perhaps yorke survived and the girl died? if this did happen yorke would likely have to flee from wherever he lived by some sort of transportation and the first few lines of this song here support that theory transport motorways and tramlines starting and then stopping taking off and landing the emptiest of feelings disappointed people clinging on to bottles and when it comes it is so so disappointing. either way let down has always seemed to me to be about nihilism depression and absolute detachment from society. the narrator watches people carry on with their everyday lives and he just does not get it. what is the point? the narrator thinks that relationships emotion and life as we know it is futile because it all fades into nothingness by the end do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel his feelings from this song has led him to some sort of superiority complex when looking at others. this leads to a developed sense of prejudice arrogance and condescension in his mind and this is expanded upon in the next song. karma police is rightfully one of radioheads most popular tunes. the haunting piano intro sets the foundation for a song about judging others and finally coming to the realization that you are no better than them. by the ethereal climax of the song the narrator realizes that this anomaly has been sorted out for his own good and he feels a renewed sense of self by distancing his prejudice phew for a minute there i lost myself i lost myself fitter happier is one of the most interesting cuts from the album and it is fairly simple. there is a computer voice that speaks slogans and capitalist motifs for a happy life it is got everything in there from holding down a job sleeping well having a wife driving a nice car eating healthy exercising and just generally being productive. this is could easily be looked at as the albums thematic centerpiece. as the album is about dehumanization and capitalist culture this song represents someone who tries his best to act according to how the experts think you should act to have a good life. despite his best efforts though he still feels powerless and empty and he realizes that this way of living does nothing but strip all this is human right form your soul calm fitter healthier and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics. electioneering is probably the most straight-forward song on here as it is just an energetic rocker on the surface. beneath the surface though it is a critique and jab at politicians and various sociopolitical affairs. this song suggests that politicians are only out for power and their own gain they do not care about the society at large. so far on this record our narrator has become disillusioned and disconnected from religion love society technology drugs culture and now politics as well. so after all that disconnect what is left for our narrator? enter climbing up the walls one of the eeriest pieces radiohead has ever made. through distortion reverb and great production radiohead create a song that not only gets in your head but also is about things going wrong in your head. this song is about the suffering and depression associated with someone who has nothing left to lose. this songs about someone whose mind and views on things are quickly deteriorating and the person losing hope. how can our narrator possibly find a way out of his precarious situation? the conclusion comes in no surprises. the glockenspiels that coat the song add a sense of irony to the whole affair. the song is about suicide and this time carbon monoxide is cited specifically. in my interpretation this would be yorkes second attempt in the album at suicide. although suicide is a hefty topic this song presents it as something more tranquil and peaceful. our narrator has realized that the american dream if you will is not meant for him. he realizes that all of these things that society says you need to have are nothing more than control tools used by the government and other corporations to keep making money and maintaining control of the population a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal you look so tired-unhappy bring down the government they do not they do not speak for us i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide lucky is one of the slower and more mesmerizing tracks on the album. thematically it is very similar to airbag and it happens to be about surviving a plane crash. fittingly enough i have come up with a theory about it. i think this song is linked closely to no surprises. bear with me here if you watch the video for said song you see thom yorke with some type of mask. the mask fills up with water and thom looks like he is about to die from suffocation when it empties. i believe the thoughts going on in no surprises are actually happening inside our narrators head while the plane crash described in lucky happens take a look at these lyrics kill me sarah kill me again with love it is going to be a glorious day pull me out of the aircrash pull me out of the lake because i am your superhero we are standing on the edge from what i can interpret perhaps sarah was the girl our narrator was enamored with in exit music. she is likely the one who died in their suicide attempt. from these lyrics one can gather that her death still troubles our narrator immensely and he likely feels responsible for her death. the second set of lines that include superhero are likely not the words of our narrator but rather the words of sarah that are still echoing in his head. sarah wants our narrator to save her the bring forth some sort of redemption. sarahs death has caused her to be viewed as a sort of hero in the narrators eyes. due to the words of sarah echoing in the narrators head he cannot go through with the suicide that was talked about and planned in no surprises. he feels like he is on the edge of a turning point in his life but he is not sure what yet. sarah is with him and together they will find an inevitable conclusion to their collective suffering. the tourist marks the end of this album and the completion of our cycle of understanding. let us take a look at the lyrics and i will try to wrap this up as well as i can it barks at no one else but me like it is seen a ghost. i guess it is seen the sparks a-flowin no one else would know. hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down. sometimes i get overcharged that is when you see sparks. they ask me where the hell i am going? at a 1000 feet per second hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down. sarahs voice is now an imminent part of the narrators brain almost like a second conscience. the voice of sarah is guiding him inside of his head almost like a ghost that is barking things at him constantly. he is going crazy and his driving reflects this. in this song he is in his car driving 1000 feet per second. let us look at these two lines i guess it is seen the sparks a-flowin no one else would know. these lines are about sarah or at least her conscience that lives inside the narrator. sarah is the only one who knows what the narrator is going through and she is seen his problems. sparks a-flowin the line no one else would know implies that sarah is the only person the narrator has gotten close enough to who would know about his tumultuous inner-tensions. then we have got the final and very important line hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down. now if you have not made the connection yet i will tell you this song is the precedent to the opening track airbag. that leads us to a couple different conclusions and i will put each one that i have thought about out there for you 1. those last lines are uttered by sarah in the narrators head she is trying to pull him to reason. soon after the narrator gets into a car accident and that is when the airbag saves him. using some of the lines from that song you can more fully see the end of the cycle in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe in a deep deep sleep of the innocent i am born again remember the lines in lucky about the superhero? well perhaps the near-death experience has given the narrator a renewed appreciation for his life. he realizes that he is a victim of society at large. the narrator is a born-again appreciator of life not unlike a born-again religious person. sarah has manifested herself into the narrators mind and the narrator realizes what he must do. he needs to save society bring them to the same understanding that he has. he needs to make them see what what he and sarah have seen. thus the loop-cycle of the album begins starting with the schizophrenic heroics of paranoid android. 2. maybe the voice that the narrator heard was not actually sarah at all. maybe it was actually the voice of a demon or some inter-dimensional being that imitated sarah to get the narrator to do what the being wanted. now what could the being have possibly wanted to gain by imitating sarah? by manipulating the narrator into near-death experiences the narrators appreciation of life is renewed before the narrator does anything drastic. maybe the reason that the narrator cannot do anything about his situation is because he himself is being controlled by forces around him. although we realize that the narrator has disconnected from almost everything he cannot transcend into anything greater than an average person until he leaves all human things behind. by the end of the album we realize that there was one thing that the narrator could not leave behind and that was sarah. sarah herself is a metaphor for human connection emotion and understanding. 3. the third explanation is the most far-fetched in my eyes but it is still worth talking about. maybe our narrator exists in the world but to him it is not the world we see it is actually his own personal purgatory or hell if you will. with this in mind it makes sense to assume that the suffering of his purgatory will never end no matter how hard he tries and fights for it to end. every time he tries to escape the purgatory manipulates him and prevents his actions. although the narrator has reached somewhat of a higher level of understanding he is doomed to stay in the same world as everyone else and watch them die or mundanely carry on doing things that do not matter. sarah then is a metaphor and an important plot device for the album. sarah represents the thing that our society is destroying and degrading beauty. the beauty that is present in all things that we reach sooner to destroy emotion love connections sympathy empathy the human condition. all of it is being destroyed and our narrator cannot stand to watch it all go. conclusion if you are still reading this i thank you for having the patience to read my theories about this record. if it was not obvious this album is very special to me. i never get sick of the guitars the pianos the synths the organs the glockenspiels the percussion the smooth and rhythmic bass or the angelic voice of yorke. many props go to nigel godrich who made this album sound like it did. modern day dark side of the moon? maybe but only time will tell that. this album has many themes important to society today. the album should be taken as a lesson and a cautionary tale. there is not much like kicking back and absorbing yourself in the malicious and non-caring world of ok computer and every time you listen to it...you cannot help but relate very deeply to it. best tracks paranoid android let down karma police no surprises lucky 9.810,1
ok computer me impact cuando era adolescente pero no tanto por sus canciones sino por su sonido que esta muy bien logrado nigel godrich so is un puto genio pop espacial atmosfrico futurista las guitarras realmente suenan muy bien es difcil encontrar otro lbum en esttica parecido a este claramente es un paso hacia adelante con respecto a su anterior trabajo the bends. airbag es un gran comienzo paranoid android es una excelente suite quizs las cancin ms compleja de la banda subterranean homesick alien funciona muy bien y es bastante atmosfrica let down es simplemente magistral karma police a pesar de que la tocan bastante en la radio me sigue pareciendo magnfica no surprises es magistral una de mis canciones favoritas de toda la vida lucky transmite una forma inusual de desesperacin bastante emotiva y the tourist me parece un ms que notable cierre con influencias slowcore claramente yorke y cia. estuvieron escuchando a low. ahora lo negativo en el lbum hay temas flojos y algunos que considerara solo como aceptables exit music for a film es algo aburrida demasiado melodramtica no encaja en el lbum el tramo final es tan hinchado y pico no me gustaba mucho a los 15 aos y ahora menos donde estn esas estupendas guitarras luminosas y atmosfricas? electioneering es otro tema que no encaja y siendo sinceros no es tan bueno climbing up the walls es pesada y larga el estribillo no tiene ni un brillo la produccin es algo exagerada y hay demasiado melodrama otra vez. en resumen ok computer an siendo un lbum con varios momentos no tan buenos posee pinculos que son realmente memorables por lo que puedo entender su estatus de disco clave de los 90s sin lugar a dudas uno de los discos con mejores singles de la dcada lstima que como conjunto sea algo inconsistente. 8.710,1

we hope that you choke. the big phrase that to many was the most memorable lyric on radioheads third lp ok computer. when i saw this lyric for the first time it was well before i had listened to the album on a banner advertising itself. by the time i was ready to listen i had imagined a thundering roar of we hope that you choke to end the album as an emotional finisher to end all finishers. instead i heard a whimpering sniveling verge-of-tears lyric over and over again at the end of exit music for a film. somehow the phrases wimpy sound gives it more of an emotional boost than any amount of screaming could have. such is the case with ok computer. the sound does not have the emotional instability and purity of many other classic albums like it. instead it wedges itself into the history of rock with a sound all its own detached reserved and genuinely depressed. this perfectly matches with the monotonous subject matter. the production is spotless and crisp keeping the music in perfect condition and bringing out instruments that would create the greatest sound possible. in short ok computer is an absolute and complete masterpiece of sonic experimentation unlike any other at the time. an lp that could only have been made by radiohead.,1
i must admit the first time i listened to radioheads ok computer i was not impressed. i guess i expected something else something more alike creep. but after a week or two i realized i would been thinking of it unconsciously and i felt a need to listen to it as i have never felt to listen anything else. i love music and i have listened to every kind of music there is since i was a young boy i love pink floyd the beatles and led zeppelin but i would never felt this way before. since that day listening to ok computer gives me goosebumps and i can truly say it is one of the best albums ever from the opening in airbag everything is just perfect the amazing suite paranoid android the surrealism on subterranean homesick alien the beauty of exit music for a film the delays in let down those amazing 8 notes in karma police when you listen to it you will know what i am talking about fitter happiers amazing lyrics and piano melody craziness inelectioneering the dark climbing up the walls and the amazing three-song set that closes the album sweet no surprises although lyrics are not so sweet pink floyd-esque lucky and mind-blowing the tourist that urges you to slow down after all the albums given to you. just simply perfection. and right after slowing down there is nothing better than feel the explosion and airbag coming into your ears again.,1
the fact that radiohead would disavow dark side of the moon as an influence tells you how much deepening of their self-awareness they still needed to do between this and the first thing they did that might begin to deserve such hyperbolic praise kid a. and while i do not have much against the rest of pink floyds discography given the binary choice i am glad this sites algorithm favors ok computer. though i do wish 1 were something... interesting. like trout mask replica. or lil boat. you know just spice it up a bit... this is a stronger album than dark side not least because mercifully they seem to have stumbled accidentally into a big concept album about the tragic inanity of modern life or somesuch by accident. while much of the songwriting is overwrought it tends to be operating at the liminal space between what consciousness can and cannot confront directly in lived experience that tends to make for good poetry. i cannot believe that roger waters was grappling with a problem that needed his talents when he wrote lines like us and them  and after all we are only ordinary men but at his best thom yorke already sounds like a gen x jeremiah. the panic! the screaming! the yuppies networking! riot shields and voodoo economics! he is like a detuned radio! one day i am going to grow wings! even having heard this album so damn many times much of it is still riveting and little of it i am looking at you subterranean homesick alien is irredeemably hokey. by any standard except conceptual sweep to be fair pink floyd is not the right comparison. in order to make it to these upper flaps of the snob rock big tent radiohead had to absorb and rejigger the canon of charting but still tasteful rock that would emerged in the last 15 year from r.e.m. to the smiths to u2. this album could not have made such a splash if the latter were not the predominant formal model through which to channel the two former. and as a result it suffers from the same problem christgau diagnosed in the joshua tree a tragic case of significance the difference being that the band seem to already have enough of an inkling to recognize it that they could course-correct. i am no steve albini but the bigness of the production and the relative lushness of the singing often lay it on too thick for my tastes. i am going to the deprivations they would subject themselves to across their next couple albums are at least as important as their electronic experiments. look at all the adulation drowning this album here on the site and consider the wisdom and courage it must have taken to so fundamentally change course.,1
if it was not for these guys i would have ended up far more happy and successful. the album that started my rot. too good.,1
such a perfect articulation of such a colossal spectrum of emotion that further discussion is basically equivalent to insulting the artists. i have no problem at all with this being declared the best album ever.,1
hello guys today i am in the mood to talk about radioheads album ok computer. why does it rank first on rym? maybe because it neither depresses your mood nor gets on your brains but instead it challenges a sense of unrealness and a desire to fly away? and even not to fly away but to float in weightlessness? a man always wants something impossible... the first ranking does not mean the best forever and for everybody it is impossible. and impossible does not mean unreal. in any case you are sure of it as long as you listen to this music.,1
today there are so many people stating that one music album is the best music album ever that seems impossible to the disheartened listener to believe such claims ever again. but i was so glad that for once an album not only met these conditions but by far exceeded them. defending myself from being charged for exaggeration i will start presenting the reasons music and songs  after listening to many different music albums i had formed the opinion that every song is a different entity inside an album like a living being. ok computer was the first album that managed to broaden my musical horizons and opinion making each one of the single living beings a part of a bigger existence a society the album as a whole while maintaining their unique-ness. the songs even though each one different have a smooth transition from one to another giving a strong impression that the whole album is one song...while it is not. the highly-talented musicians of radiohead come to boost the significance of this experience with their great guitar drums and synthesizer parts in each song while complimenting the lyrics meaning the guitar sounds alien in subterranean homesick alien the guitar and drums sound paranoid in the existential and unique paranoid android. lyrics  the lyrics of this specific album hold a great importance because they are not just expressing concerns and thoughts about our present and future society they are making social and political commentary on an era that is changing rapidly in all levels centered on the technological advance. the album express the stress and fear of the citizens about this advance while not forgetting the political manipulations that push forward these advances when needed. creativity  the songs sound different with the brilliant conducting of nick ingman feel different when taking in consideration the inspired lyrics and can be considered one entity. if this is not creative please feel free to tell me so. lasting impression and value  this is a haunting experience. never before a music album felt so refreshing inspiring thoughtful and creative while reflecting the emotions of some deeply concerned with the societys problems music artists. that is when a band of artists produces a timeless music album... because art is timeless.,1
what am i missing? with such an impossible amount of praise and esteem placed on ok computer i cannot help but wonder how much effect it has on my judgment. but all i have are my current thoughts which are that it is just not doing it for me all that much. just nice moments here and there.,1
i honestly believe the gucci little piggy set thom straight. before 97 during the bends era thom was writing songs about anxiety the negative aspects of fame isolation and destruction among other themes. after the gucci incident thom was writing songs of anxiety the negative aspects about fame isolation and destruction among other themes only this time they were sophisticated. ok computer essentially expanded upon and improved the bends. airbag  saved thom yorkes life. the car-crash did thom well as he crafted an intriguing song. he gives two thumbs up to the german auto industry as well as the tibetan belief of reincarnation. the band also acknowledges the cure in one of the songs motif. the star of this track though is phil. kudos to him for the way he handled those robotic beatz. paranoid android is a sophisticated rhapsody. complex in nature with alternating rhythms and time signatures this is the origin of the little piggy. as epic as it is paranoid does not achieve what it set out to achieve and that is making the band not take themselves seriously. ah well... this subterranean homesick alien sure knows his melody. the ethereal soundscape this song produces is beyond comprehension. thom dissects human nature from the eyes of aliens. trippy. exit music for romeo and juliet. it also saved marylin mansons life. i do not know how you should take that. let down is one hell of a contender for most depressing song in the album. it is also the one song that unifies all the loose concepts into one. truly a masterpiece fit for anyones rock standards list. karma police...phew for a minute there i lost my cell. check that ending out. fitter happier is the song that influenced me to buy microwave dinners. got to go get my antibiotics. electioneering is as clear as a diamond. sadly it is as rough as one too. solid song but nothing more to it. climbing up the walls is dexters theme. it is also the theme to everyone is inner demons with malice afterthoughts. easily replaceable with palo alto. so we hit the carbon monoxide inducing no surprises. contending for the most depressing song in the album no surprises is yorkes reaction to the systematic destruction of citizens by contemporary society. do not drown... lucky is my favorite song from the album. those flamenco guitars made me break down crying in the middle of a plane trip seriously. the tourist should be played in every single subway across the world. the ending bing sound puts the finishing touches to one of the greatest artistic statement in history. it is no surprise ok computer is one of the greatest experiences of all time. this includes websites music-videofilms artworks stanley is a beast and of course the album itself. this is how i view ok computer not as an album but as a work of multimedia art. this will always be radioheads magnum opus.,1
damn good album. is it just me or are these remasters an actual improvement on original? nigel godrich did a hell of a job on the boards. every sonic detail really glides is how i can explain it like sun pouring over ice. the rhythm section and keyboards really carries the day on songs like airbag. i listened to a few 90s pop hits recently. i think the thing that lot of 90s nostalgists overlook is impact of hip hop on rock drummers. them breaks! the jazzy shuffle on paranoid android and the bells an whistles xylophones i think really trick this out. and that rich and melodic bass does much more than hold the rythm. every player knows when to drop out or make space for the other. really great b sides first time i have heard most of them. i think he made his millions mewling and caterwualing over johnnys guitar arpeggios. i wonder what radiohead would have been like had they continued in this proggy i never payed as much attention to how much the keyboard adds to the mix. the remixes are surprisingly not shite never was a zero 7 booster. fitter happier and electioneering are better than i remembered. what else can i say? not my number 1 but it certainly has greatness in it.,1
so the journey begins. starting with the 1 all-time rym album and working down -- one day at a time until exhaustion. can this really be 16 years old? it stands as a pure crystalline structure. a true work of art. i stand in awe of the ambition and forethought that went into this album. whether intentional or not they composed the future. 16 years ago before my palate had developed i felt this album to be highly top-loaded. i now see the album as a whole with the schizophrenic paranoid opening followed by the sense of resignation. it is a scary yet beautifully realized vision. kudos. how could you not rate this album a 5? to do so would be to disregard all antecedents and the direction of the music that followed. greatest album of all time? i do not think so but i will try hard to prove it so. greatest album of the past 20 years -- yes! ----- high point 250 into exit music for a film when the drums and that scuzzed out bass hit. wow,1
ok computer is an incredibly layered paranoid work. its originality means that it has not aged a day and it will remain one of the great albums of the 1990s.,1
god loves his children. compared to later radiohead releases ok computer just seems like a foundation. do not get me wrong the songs are excellent with classics such as the tourist paranoid android and karma police and the overall feel of the album the themes the haunting lyrics the hollow sounds and spine chilling textures make this an extremely thought provoking release that not only changed the face of alt. rock but pushed the whole genre of rock to new boundaries. it deserves all the praise it has garnered most certainly but kid a is much much better. numerous albums can take ryms 1 album spot and while ok computer certainly is not anywhere near bad radiohead and many other artists have done much better. highlights - karma police - paranoid android - exit music for a film - the tourist - subterranean homesick alien,1
this album gives me so many feels. it really is better than kid a not that kid a was a bad album it was a great album this is just slightly better.,1
an acquired taste. i thought it was crap on first listen mainly because it was soo different to the music that was going around at the time. but after several more listens i loved it.,1
i was not always a huge fan of radiohead. for a long period of my life i found their music hard to get into and at times rather dull. they were one of the most acclaimed british bands of all time and i just did not get it. one year i went to the leeds festival and they were headlining and despite a lot of my friends being excited about the prospect of seeing them i just was not fussed as i was not a fan. despite this i thought i would go and see them anyway as i heard they were good live and by the end of their set i finally did get it. to describe their show using a word which does not do it justice it was mindblowing. i stubbornly tried not to pursue my interest in them as i wanted to stick to my word of not being a fan but i just could not help myself. i fell in love with them and felt like such an idiot for previously dismissing their clearly incredible music. my friends would tease me about the huge you-turn i did in regards to my stance on radiohead but i did not care. i finally knew just why so many regard them as one of the greatest bands ever. during a period of listening to little else but thom yorkes intricate innovative boundary pushing conglomerate of world class musicians i came to find that ok computer is my favourite album of theirs. a lot of people cite kid a as their finest work and i agree that it is an incredible album but there is something so irrepressibly epic about this album. it marks the point between where they were still a conventional guitar band and where they delved into uncharted musical territory. the songs are primarily guitar driven but the guitars are used to create noises that you would not expect. paranoid android is one of the greatest songs ever written. period. it has been compared to queens bohemian rhapsody many times. not surprising. both songs begin in a rather quiet place before becoming louder and louder before culminating in an explosive climax which features iconic guitar work. but whilst bohemian rhapsody is an epic opus of glam and stadium rock glory paranoid android is anything but glorious. it is nihilistic and bitter cynical and schizophrenic volatile and misanthropic. the tempos change the guitars become gnarlier and the vocals become angrier. the band have said that they wrote the song as a joke. strange because jokes serve the basic purpose of making someone laugh not making someone feel several emotions. the other singles are amazing too. no surprises with it is distinctive guitar hook is a rather poignant but cathartic number whilst the slow paced lucky is pure bleakness featuring guitars that make the darkness sound beautiful. karma police is like the twisted demented cousin of oasis do not look back in anger. that song is like an affable friend whilst this one is a lone creepy person. the album is consistently great. airbag emits textures of ambience using nothing but guitars and electioneering is the sound of the apocalypse if you could hear someone playing an amazing guitar solo whilst the world is being destroyed around you. just when the golden period of british rock which was the 1990s looked like it was starting to die with oasis releasing the self indulgent coke addled and critically panned but nonetheless good be here now blur looking to the american grunge bands for influences as opposed to writing their usual quirky pop songs pulp also wanting to avoid the britpop sound which made them popular and the manic street preachers losing their angry punk-esque nihilisim in favour of radio friendly anthems radiohead emerged with this masterpiece. they showed to the world that there was more to music from the united kingdom than britpop and as opposed to the fun anthemic poppy songs of britpop this album is anything but. it is dark brooding and misanthropic. and better than definitely maybe parklife and different class. the only british albums from the 1990s that i can think of which are superior to ok computer are the holy bible by the manic street preachers and pulps this is hardcore two albums which are also dark and uncomfortable to listen to and are the sound of a band deliberately trying to alienate casual listeners for the sake of artistic license. moral of the story is give any band a chance. do not dismiss them just because you do not like the sound of them and if you follow that rule you may end up reaping the rewards of it like i was with radiohead.,1
with an album as renowned and legendary as ok computer you would think that all contemporary reviews could just be whittled down to a generic what can be said about this album that has not already been said? but that is not the case. 20 years later and people are still finding things to say about this album. maybe it is because younger people keep discovering. maybe it is because people find that its themes of technological anxiety are being more relevant with time. maybe it is both. especially with its 20th anniversary this year it is been back in the spotlight and the center of dozens of articles on music sites. one i saw from pitchfork described fitter happiers lyrics as robot overlords commands for humans or something like that. i know music is very subjective but i do not think i am alone in thinking that pitchfork is way off with that interpretation. thom yorke himself has called fitter happiers lyrics as the most depressing thing he is ever written. the track is not much more than a list of mundane qualities and lifestyle choices that are typically deemed desirable and by the general public. tv magazines our peers they all tell us that going to the gym is good safe cars are good eating healthily is good. everybody should do these things. everybody on earth should be the same and live this ideal western lifestyle. and what do you say to this list? no i do not want to eat healthy or get along with coworkers or worry about my safety! of course not you would be an asshole. thom says these are his most depressing lyrics and i think it is because the advice this robotic voice is giving is not bad advice. a lot of the things he said would lead to the ideal life. you could stray from this advice but what would it lead to? reckless behaviour binge drinking an irritating personality and ultimately social isolation. the title of the album is an allusion to the submissive acceptance of the sterile benign instructions for a normal life. he is not saying i shall do your bidding computer! but he is also not saying no way fuck your advice computer! it is just an unenthused ok computer. i think that is why people find this album so depressing because it is an acceptance of the societal assimilation of uniqueness. no use fighting it you cannot survive unless you conform to the way the world works. a more and more calculated lifestyle the only casualty is a unique human experience. ok,1
when it comes to rock music and its million sub-genres i am barely scratching the surface. the reason for that is that with the exception of a few albums i used to not care for rock. in reality i just thought that i did not like rock...because i was so close minded. i have since broadened my musical horizons and realized that there are gems in nearly every genre. of the many gems i have discovered in rock this album is one of the best. given it is high reputation i expected to think that it is overrated even taking into consideration that rym is more rock-oriented than i will ever be. however i love this album. i could spend all day describing the technical details that make it great but ultimately what it boils down to is that this is simply put fantastic music. that is all there is to it. it is rock but it is for everyone not just rock fans. if you do not like sad music ok then maybe this album is not for you. but for everyone else i do not see what is not to love. this album has great vocals excellent instrumentation several classic songs a great overall vibe subtle influences from a variety of genres and a perfect balance of experimentation and accessibility. if you do not like this album i guess i cannot complain because music is a highly subjective art form. however i will not agree with you in the slightest. this album is amazing it makes me want to dig into radioheads discography and it is one of the albums that has inspired me to dig deeper into rock music in general. it is a rock classic if i ever heard one. rating 4.55,1
dit is een van de laatste grote albums alvorens het mp3-tijdperk de meeste artiesten terug dwong om net zoals in de jaren 50 te focussen op singles. zowat elk nummer op dit album is een episch anthem waarmee radiohead een nieuwe rockstandaard zette voor het einde van de jaren 90 en een groot deel van het volgende decennium. dit album was een complete breuk met het verleden en nog steeds kruipen de meeste nummers op dit album volledig onder je huid en telkens je het album opnieuw luistert lijkt het er alleen maar ng beter op te worden. stevige gitaaruithalen worden op een zeer effectieve manier afgewisseld met etherische koren met vooral de stem van zanger thom yorke als een constante die alles op een zeer hoog niveau houdt. vooral paranoid android geldt als het ultieme nummer op dit album. het bevat zoveel lagen dat het telkens opnieuw blijft verrassen en je van de ene emotie in de andere doet duikelen. het is duidelijk dat we hier te maken hebben met enkele geniale muzikanten die weten hoe een nummer aan kracht kan winnen. het gaat hier niet om een kijk-mama-zonder-handen-attitude maar werkelijk om songstructuren waar velen iets van kunnen leren en die van radiohead misschien wel de grootste groep van de jaren 90 maakte. in ieder geval kan dit album bijgezet worden in het selecte rijtje tijdloze klassiekers en is ongetwijfeld een van de topalbums van de jaren 90.,1
el disco ms sobrevalorado de todos los tiempos. aguanta pero ni es patanto,1
picture a chilly winter morning inside a university classroom. the professor was running so late that i had enough time to be able to listen to this album in its entirety before he finally arrived and i will always remember that time whenever i sit down and listen to this release. ok computer is at the point where radiohead began experimenting with their musical formula going beyond the britpop sound found on their previous releases. thom yorkes ethereal vocals synergize well with the creative use of rock instruments present throughout the album. the low ambient atmosphere of this release lulls the listener into a sense of peace and heightened observation in order to try and detect what exactly yorke is trying to say in these songs. the tracks here are quality alternative rock that capture the experimental nature of the late 1990s and can please most anyone. standouts are airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down and electioneering with fitter happier as an honorable mention for its exclusive use of voice synthesizers of which i am a fan.,1
this is the album that got me into radiohead and it will always hold a special place in my heart because of it. truly incredible. the emotion in airbag gets me every time,1
mindblowing at least for the time now its just a pretty good record,1
ok so i have got a challenge for you this weekend you may have already listened to it in full but it is worth it to hear again listen to ok computer all the way through with some ear buds on that is one of the most nostalgic albums for me man and my early days working at shaw that takes me back to a time when i was still kind of fat and goofy which i mean to be fair that will be a trait i am always stuck fighting but needless to say my mind was in a different spot. i was into my first year of marriage at shaw when i first started out there and nothing was very easy for me. i had a hard transition into marriage and work and living on my own for the first time. but this album made that 145 ride from downtown dalton to conn 3 something i looked forward to. i can remember when my group in qc had a cd player near the roll prep area if you were cutting plastic off the rolls you could blare music and i remember putting in ok computer and everybody just staring at each other like this are not kz 106 or this are not pop but nobody fuckin did anything about it...i honestly believe they did not touch it or say anything because i have caught some shit for some of the stuff i have listened to in there because this is one of the best albums of all time nothing has ever sounded like it it managed to be super melon collie and more tuneful and as heavy as a smashing pumpkin song and being as tippy as anything on dark side of the moon. it is beautiful i am sure there is at least 50 guitar pedals used on this fuckin thing and they all sound awesome i mean i am in fucking tears right now listening to this shit it is just that i have had so much on my plate lately and everything in this world has gotten so fuckin rough i am not trying to sound like a pussy but maybe i have just holding on to too much baggage i do not know i am fine now but for a minute i just needed to cry but i got to ask myself now if things were any easier back then you know,1
sonic perfection. the best concept album ever createdyea i went there. i feel really bad for people who do not like this album.,1
no se puede creer tanta evolucin en tan poco tiempo se dieron cuenta de la capacidad que tenan y lo explotaron aqu lo mejor de lo mejor ,1
in the mid 90s i loved the bends and also thought pablo honey had its charms. ok computer came out and i thought that while it is had some good tunes without being able to put my finger on it i just felt there was something not quite right about it. a couple of years after it came out on a christmas eve in fact i was coming down with the chicken pox although i did not actually know it yet. i was feeling a bit spacey and a bit out of it and had this record on and it is the first time i remember it clicking with me specifically the song lucky. this was when i realised that the something not quite right feeling was purposefully built into the album by radiohead it was the essence of what the band wanted to get across. since i first came up with my favourite 10 albums of all time list probably 14 or 15 years ago now there have been a couple of changes but ok computer has been a consant. it is gotten better with age and now never fails to blow my mind. its records like this that make me so passionate about music. airbag introduces the album with a riff that is got a hint of the east about it but the vocals guitars and rhythm section come together beautifully to begin this masterpiece. only radiohead could write something so magical about a car safety device. this leads into the epic paranoid android up there with bohemian rhapsody as one of those songs whose creation process will raise as many questions as the origins of the universe itself. the paranoia levels are maintained across the rest of the album. at its heart is the track let down a song that just swells with downbeat emotion and is one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded by a rock band. electioneering and climbing up the walls give you that frantic feeling of being stuck in a broken elevator and are particularly easy to relate to these days. no surprises calms everything back down and the album cruises to a relaxed finish with lucky and the tourist. alot of my friends are big music fans and i would have a high degree of respect their opinions. some of them just do not get this record. maybe they need to listen to it while coming down with the chicken pox -,1
i struggle to find words to describe my love for this album. incredible amazing mind-blowing and transcendent are just a few that i can come up with. admittedly the first time i heard the album i did not really think much of it. then on the second time i was blown away by it. by far my favorite album.,1
i cannot deny how pretty jonny plays. karma police is mediocre at best - definitely the worst song on the album. best songs subterranean homesick alien airbag no surprises let down,1
among my fathers favourites - guy mitchell perry como andy williams roger whittaker doris day val doonican connie francis mario lanza. on hearing ok computer two weeks ago he remarked hey these guys are pretty good... i want his grandchildren to be in a band like radiohead i want them to sing like thom yorke fuck around like the boy greenwood that son of a bitch obrien i want them to be pussies like radiohead tough vicious bastards like radiohead cold cynical beautiful lost heartbroken ecstatic with enlightenment so in control they nearly puke all over themselves so smug they buzz around like flies near the turds of whatever generation they will surely disown after they hear this just like their future grandpa did.,1
two important things about ok computer. 1 it is not the best album ever. 2 it is not a pile of talentless shit either. ok computer is an obvious example of specific taste this is a love it or hate it album for the most part. its eerie odd all over the place and somewhat distant its solid in what it is but by no means does it impress me. its a good album worth the time of anyone who desires to hear every kind of music at least once like i am. if you simply want to search for the sound you want and know it is out there but do not know what that sound is you do have to check this album out for yourself do not follow any ones overwhelming opinions like the 2 examples i used and if you do check this album out good luck friend. --------- what a cryptic statement of mine that is. its about a year later since that review whatever it is and i have decided after extensive musical discoveries since then to start the year 2013 with a radiohead day because their discography really is one i need to get through. having listen to every album twice more or less and relistening to ok computer i would like to say i have a much much much better grip and understanding of this band. so here it goes my much better review of ok computer starting with airbag this song is way better than i remember making me think of our lady peaces naveed and then the surprising warping of noise at the end which i have to say i really like. now i hear paranoid android is considered still to this day one of radioheads best songs and they might be right its very powerful and kind of like airbag but with more purpose and emotion. something this album suddenly feels to weigh out to me  purpose. subterranean homesick alien is rather spacious and easy though it glides and does not feel like a pointless we need this ballad like many songs of this structure feel to me in later albums. i never really got why people compared muse to radiohead but now let down has showed it to me damn. but i will say let down is beautiful again spacious and with real not forced emotion and some since of strange purpose. very very good song. karma police is another very just wow rather genuine and clean not stained by the ego i think this band gains in later years. to me this album is just working on music not on the image radio head seems to garner after this album. maybe this is what happened. this was the catalyst i think i am getting it now. more about that later. more reminding me of our lady peace with electioneering which has some killer guitar which most of the album really does. the back and forth with the upbeat and melancholy really gives an odd but delightful vibe to this album something i feel is lost on later albums actually. the prime example is after the happy and energetic electioneering you get saturated in melancholy with the dismal and powerful climbing up the walls. i guess they thought hey let us get even sadder with no surprises but i will say there is a slight feeling of hopefulness in those lullaby like twinkles and atmosphere. besides really good guitar and that deep space feeling on very song lucky and the tourist just follow in the steps of climbing up the walls and no surprises but not as good i guess but there is not a bad song on this album not at all. hopefully i understand this album way better now than i did a year ago. i feel like i do. its pure its genuine and very common and that makes it rather uncommon. i feel like the albums to follow do not possess this genuine feeling not trying to say they lost themselves but rather found themselves and knew what to do therefore radiohead gained much confidence and cockiness therefore losing their modesty. but they are still really talented so i guess. i guess its ok.,1
ok computer is one of very few albums that allow the listener to inhabit a whole different world. it is an emotional cry for a sense of sanity in the late hours of any given night one of the greatest most transcendent musical achievements in the history of human civilization.,1
this is artificial beauty. beautiful anyway.,1
i do not understand why this is the best album ever. i mean yeah is good and it has some radios anthems paranoid surprises karma but...really? the best ever? there are some reeeeeally boring parts and thoms voice does not help in there. still yeah...most of the album is remarkable i agree with you guys. highlights airbag paranoid android fitter happier no surprises.,1
making your way through a technological wasteland. let down is one of the greatest things to happen.,1
rym rates this album as the best of all time i disagree that spot comes close between dark side of the moon and abbey road but ok computer is not  kid a is better  well anyway its a great album and the only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star album is fitter happier  seriously wtf where they thinking???  and lucky  it is very overrated average song ,1
i have owned this on cd about five or six times. its always close by always gets fucked eventually always absolutely essential for me to get it again.,1
the singing sometimes sounds mumblymoaning the last song or two is kind of boring and i find fitter happier to be kind of pretentious but over all a pretty damn good album,1
kiedy w 97 roku wychodzi ok computer radiohead kojarzythem gwnie z britpopem i bythem lekko skonsternowany pozytywnymi recenzjami szczeglnie w uk. w kocu na wyprzeday w poznaskim rocklonglucku kupithem wtedy jeszcze kaset i zajechathem j do cna. pyta absolutnie wyjtkowa i moim zdaniem szczytowe osignicie radiohead. aden pniejszy album niestety nie wytrzymuje porwnania z ok computer.,1
they do not like to be associated with prog but there is no denying that on ok computer radiohead went full-on art rock. whilst i do not think it is a five-star classic - it flags a little too much in the second half for that and fitter happier is just too ludicrously over the top and juvenile for words - it does attain higher peaks than any prior radiohead album.the albums masterpiece is of course the pocket symphony which is paranoid android - beginning as a political rant segueing into a strung-out hymn and then returning to the angry diatribe for the conclusion and in the course of all this proving to the alternative rock crowd that there was something to be gained from cribbing from updating the ideas of the art rock heroes of the past.,1
it is the symphonie of the feeling that most afflicts to human race the pain. it is a journey through the pure essence we have fought against since our origin. at the moment we are born until we die we experience that feeling all the time. thom yorke and company do open heart surgery and expose us the aesthetics of pain.,1
note i want to have a review written for at least the top 50 albums by the time this summer is over. this is the first review in that project. when this album was released i was a year and a half old. i doubt my dad ever played it for me when i was so young actually talking to him about the album years later when i was fourteen or fifteen he explained to me that it took him six months to buy it because he wanted to wait for the hype to die down. he was afraid that if he bought it right away he would be disappointed. after the soaring angst-filled yet beautiful the bends my dad was among the many waiting for the best pop album of all time. it is probably for the best that he tempered his expectations. this album was not made for him. he still enjoyed it of course -- but radiohead had something else in mind. it is actually strange to me then because this is the first album i have a distinct memory of listening to really listening to free of distractions giving my full attention. i was in third grade. my dad would play fitter happier sometimes and i thought it was funny. i thought the song itself was called ok computer. i had a shitty little cd player i would had it for a few years then. by this point it had lost the ability to skip tracks. so i popped in the cd and figured i would just wait for it to get to track 7 thought it would only take a few minutes. i do not remember what i thought of airbag then but i do remember listening to paranoid android for the first time very clearly. the eerie jangly guitar that opens the song grabbed my attention immediately. and the sudden mood shifts scared the crap out of me. it was probably the most progressive song i had heard up till that point but i do not know for sure. but i remember it so clearly. the problem with this album and writing about it is that it is become impossible for me -- and so many others -- to separate their emotional bonds with it from the musics actual individual merit. but i think that is in part because thom yorke and co. did such a brilliant job at tapping right into the reservoirs of existential angst that were following us as the 90s turned over into the new millennium. even exit music for a film which could have been a simple throwaway track for the romeo  juliet soundtrack has the haunting mellotron arrangement gently whispered vocals the jaw-dropping drum break and of course the eerie samples during the fade out. and it is basically the best song ever written for a movie in my opinion. yet it was not even nominated for the original song oscar. wonder why. i know i rated a stretch of tracks 4 and under -- but that is in part because those tracks do not really transcend the beauty of the album. well karma police was a victim of being awfully overplayed. it is a good tune but i am a little bitter that it was the most successful single from the album here in the you.s. electioneering is a great rocker and would be a highlight on any other album but here it plays it safe in comparison to the crazy innovations we see elsewhere on the album. climbing up the walls is brilliant and the string arrangement is mindblowing but it is also so painfully bleak that it is tough for me to listen to when i am not listening to the album straight through. but i would not bat an eye if someone else were to cite them as a highlight they are just not what stood out to me. but i feel the album hits its peaks when thom mixes cautious optimism into the albums generally bleak uncertain mood. no surprises is a bright but melancholy song and it is unbelievable to me that it reached the top 10 in the you.k. and then there is let down. let down is probably my favorite song of all time. that is partially because it is gotten me through lots of tough times but it is also brilliant musically. let me outline why i think this for you 1. the guitar is playing in a different time signature than the rest of the song. this plays back into the songs general idea of trying to find your place in the world. 2. each element of the song gets more and more confident as the song goes on. for example the uncertain guitar which opens the song shifts to being assertively strummed at the songs climax. similarly thoms vocals which at first sound fragile and vulnerable shift to confident graceful and soaring. 3. the lyrical turns of phrase allow the songs chorus one day i am going to grow wingsa chemical reaction to turn from an ironic scathing comment on todays society i.e. there are so many chemicals in the world that i will mutate grow wings and escape to a life-affirming sentiment when they are prefaced with you will know you will know where you are... 4. when the harmonies kick in at 400 it is perhaps my favorite moment in any song and has moved me to tears several times. 5. the outro -- which consists of an acoustic guitar and arpeggiating synths -- has the comforting effect which drives home the ultimate point which i drew from the song that is everything will be okay. the thing is i have only begun to skim the surface and i could do this for every song on this album. all of them. i will not but the point is this is an incredible album the kind of album where i would not question anyone choosing any track as their favorite. and it is become such a deeply ingrained personal album for me but i am confident that everyone with an interest in rock music can find something here. i wonder if i will see another album like this released in my lifetime. who knows? do they make them like this anymore?,1
i had read soo many reviews for this before i even listened to it it was popping up everywhere and even one of my favourite rappers made an ill reference to itsee do not see us by the roots. i eventually listened when i decided to venture into rock music and i was blown away. just listen to it not much i can say really.,1
much as i love everything that came after this is still my favourite radiohead album. where they still took the songwriting as seriously as the sound. it just has that classic album feel of capturing the time in which it was recorded and but also feels strangley timeless.,1
totalmente inflado ni por casualidad tan bueno como lo presentan,1
sometimes there comes something that one way or another changes the way we see something be it a movie a game a series anything. other times said event does not just change our view on certain things it changes our view about everything. sometimes said event can last for a little while other times it is something that we shall remember for the rest of our lives should we embrase it. ok computer is the latter one to me. it is an album that changed my view on everything about this world music specially. it is an album that it simply has everything. it is not as difficult to get into as many other album it is not a simple catchy listen it is intelligent it is atmospheric it is experimental it is touching it is disturbing it is funny it is not uber pretentious it is inspirational it is everything. does it deserve to be number one on the site? that is... too subjective and too arguable and opininonaded and it is better to just not dwel on that but the answer is in my eyes clear. my my rateyourmusic you have taste.,1
i will not listen to much after karma police besides no surprises and lucky i think the rest is pretty much filler. the great songs are great but i think the rest are not as amazing. i think the bends is much more consistent but still the best songs on here are the best they made i.e. paranoid android subterranean... exit music and let down are some of the 4 best tracks in a row on any album. update climbing up the walls is incredible and i do not know how i missed that for so long when i finally got it the song blew my mind. still do not think the tourist is as good as street spirit but overall when this album is good there are not many bands that can do much better. just noticed this album is at 1 beating out the beatles and pink floyd while i agree as far as the beatles except mayyybe abbey road and say this and dark side are about neck and neck. and judging from the ratings it looks like they are.,1
subterranean homesick alien is a personal favourite. let down most radiohead fans favourite. yes yes we have all heard about how radiohead is abhorrently unoriginal for lending beatles track sexy sadie musical idea for karma police. but a mega f-off to those guys this is better than sexy sadie. erm fitter happier is a poem not a song rite? electioneering when i go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet. when i go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet. hahaha climbing up the walls about madmen. no surprises one of the poppiest radiohead songs. with the spirit of a young teenager. a personal favourite. prefer the live version though while i do not think this is an intended concept album a term which the band hates being applied to ok computer and while the themes in the songs seem very varied when seen individually escapism the hypocrisy of politics insanity in the context of its times it makes sense. a truly symbolic snapshot of the 2000s and the birth of stressful modern times before it happened. ok computer 1 airbag 4.0 2 paranoid android 5.0 3 subterranean homesick alien 4.0 4 exit music for a film 3.5 5 let down 4.5 6 karma police 4.5 7 fitter happier -.- 8 electioneering 3.75? 9 climbing up the walls 3.5 10 no surprises 4.5 11 lucky 4.5 12 the tourist 3.5 overall 3.87 strangely low probably because of the tourists length impression 4.5 colossal album cover dated or snapshot-like? 3.5,1
yes i am another radiohead fanboy. so if you do not want to read another person gush about this record it is best you just move on. the question i get from my friends and a few anonymous on-line individuals is why? or why this record? as if there is a simple objective response that could answer it. maybe at the time of its release in 1997 i was simply bored of music and i was craving something different and when i first heard paranoid android and saw the provocative video i let out a wow! this is different! cry and latched onto the radiohead sound. all i know is i listen to 95 of my music collection on shufflerandom play. this cd i do not and cannot. airbag is like foreplay to me with the bass line and the christmas-like bell sounds of the tambourine. paranoid android then invests me into the record. i start thinking in abstract visuals and then ride along with journey of tracks 3 to 6 with let down a perfect rebound to exit music. after the break provided by fitter happier i get fed energy of electioneering and climbing up the walls and then get to wind down to the final three haunting songs. i feel like i have been concentrating on something that one cannot possibly concentrate on. i am left feeling like i had an ear and brain workout. it is been 16 years and i do not go a month without taking this journey.,1

a big step forward musically and sonically if not particularly song wise from the bends the bands follow up ok computer is touted as the dark side of the moon of its generation and counted as one of the best albums ever made in music polls . what you actually hear is a band experimenting  with electronic textureswith nods to prog rock and eastern musics in the guitar sounds with atonal effects and vintage synths. it says a lot for the bands natural melodicism that they manage to make the whole thing sound so appealing even though its far from commercial. much of that of course is to do with yorkes vocals -superbly recorded and performed. from the droning guitars and squelchy synth sounds of airbag through the suite like paranoid android and the white album homage of karma police the record rarely loses its focus . its perfectly sequenced in a way records were in the old days. let downs twinkling 12 strings and oppressive melancholy and luckys soaring stadium downer rock are 2 of the finest moments in the bands catalogue. climbing up the walls doomy paranoia on the other hand would give tricky nightmares. the bands confidence is quite staggering they know they are brilliant. only the flat out rock of electioneering feels a little forced otherwise ok computer is one of those rare albums that fitted the times perfectly  capturing the hollow sadness at the core of our modern technology based materialistic driven existance perfectly and it catapulted the band to a new level of fame . not that they have played it safe there once  no siree .,1
i guess i should write a little bit about this album since i placed it on the highest of the high on my top albums list the one inside my head mind you for the longest time. there are moments when i tell myself that this is not as good as i really think it is. honestly i do feel like the hype has brainwashed a lot of people but since i have limited myself to media and critical exposure for some time to give myself my own clear opinions i really do love this album. a lot. i still remember the first time i ever heard it. the minute i heard the song lucky i was facinated enamoured etc etc. that month i probably listened to this album every fucking day. i do not know how i did it but i was just so obsessed. i wanted to absorb every little note and soundwave coming out of my speakers. everything was so layed out in front of me this album in my mind what i have always wanted musically but never had until this moment. end pretentious rant. this album still makes me feel this way. now that i have moved on to a wider spectrum of music and not purely dad-rock like when i first heard this album i truly understand it is role in the music world that it played when it first released. ok computer is truly a brilliant piece of semi-cynical art that will always be a part of my life. it is not my favorite album anymore but it is the one that started everything for me. it gave me and my 12 year old self hope that there was modern art worth listening to. maybe the youtube commenters on beatles songs should give this a listen and quit praising the beatles like they are demigods. that little part in let down you know the one is still one of the most amazing things i have ever heard. 55 for the rest of my life,1
i started listening to radiohead because i stumbled upon the song subterranean homesick alien and i listended to that only because of the clever title a nod to dylans subterranean homesick blues. i liked it enough to listen to it again but it did not really excite me. that was probably 2 months ago. i now recongize the brilliant song writing arragement production work that this song along with the rest of ok computer demonstrated. i do not believe i am alone in saying it took several listenings before i actually loved ok computer. perhaps this is mood music but i personally feel albums do not get much better than this. it is not perfect. no album is. 5.5,1
this is not overrated... but the five star rating is not for me. it is a beautiful soundscape and a great gift to give to anyone who never heard it when it came out. its a stupendous gift for young people. there are many non-hipsters who have never heard of this release or at the very least simply do not listen to radiohead based on the only relative strength of their latest few releases. if you have not heard it in awhile it is always good to throw this on and sit down and have a nice think.,1
i have listened to this hundreds of times first i scored it with 4.5 stars because i got used to its sound but i had to change it today to 5 i absolutely love this album. they are now tied with loveless i cannot decide which one is the best of the 90s.,1
at first i did not like it but after a couple of listens i realized how amazing this album is. not my favorite radiohead album still mindblowing. 55,1
this is the first radiohead album i listened to and it led me deeper into their catalog. once deeper into their catalog it led me to appreciate and seek out similar music that i never would have looked for without having heard radioheads albums. for me this album is a perfect blend of pop and more experimental songs that flow well throughout the album. a journey through a rigid cold modern existence.,1
most overrated album of all time but it has some good songs like no surprises  the tourist  and karma police good album but not the best.,1
creo que es excesivo que la grabacin permanezca en primera posicin de su ao pero as son las cosas. claramente nos encontramos ante un disco bsico de msica pop. puede gustar ms o menos su cadencia su tono melanclico pero est bien parido. se cuidan las melodas y contiene temas ya antolgicos como paranoid android o lucky. quiz el mejor trabajo de una de las bandas ms sobrevaloradas en la actualidad.,1
ya lleg al numero 1... bueno hace meses... y es esa formula que hace que quien es mas votado supere al mejor votado si tiene menos votos como es el caso del abbey road sensiblemente mejor puntuado. pero realmente es tan bueno? el paso del tiempo nos ha aclarado que ese movimiento algo desestructurado y electrnico con una voz medio melanclica ha sido la base de las principales tendencias de grupos independientes de rock alternativo. no es tan electrnico como entonces pensbamos pero mejor. pero que le ha pasado al abbey road... cuando escucho la obra maestra de los beatles el tiempo me pasa rpido... esto no me pasa con ok computer. y no es que me haga de entendido en la materia. sencillamente eso es lo que me pasa. si estoy haciendo otra cosa el abbey road siempre tiene mi atencin. esto no pasa con ok computer. en algunos momentos se me olvida incluso que lo estoy oyendo. habr inventado una nueva manera de valorar discos???? no obstante el disco no esta nada mal.,1
this is strange - i really cannot accept this album being the greatest of all time but at the same time i cannot give it less than 5 stars...,1
this is an undeniably spectacular album. certainly the dark side of the 90s generation. like dark side this album manages to channel a simple melancholic vibe that seemingly serves as a commentary on existence as defined by the times. dark side was steeped in the context of crass consumerism and the rise of the me generation. ok computer is steeped in the rise of crass technologism and the rise of the look at me generation. like dark side it is one of those albums you do not just listen to it is an album you experience. the sonicry seems to take on an extra dimension and it as though it is being absorbed by all of your senses. it is music that seeks out total immersion. i will say ok computer does not really call for me personally as much as dark side still does. ok computer seems to have just a bit of cold detachment to it and just is not quite as universal in feeling as dark side. there is the other issue that radiohead for me kind of went off the rails after this album and rightly or wrongly it has sullied my desire to listen to anything radiohead even this marvelous album. however that all aside objectively speaking there can be no doubt that this is a 5-star album that deserves its place in rock history and esteem. as of this writing it is 1 on rym just ahead of dark side. i of course would flip the two but i can agree with it being in that neighborhood. it honestly is probably the last great rock album that was ever written. which honestly is quite a sad commentary on the state of rock music in the 21st century but that is a discussion for another place and time.,1
the top spot on rym of this album is what caught my attention and got me started listening to radiohead about nine months ago so i am approaching this album fifteen years after it was released. this was not what i expected - it sounds a little like a more hip version of eighties marillion. the first six songs on this are all great. the album does get a little weak in the middle - fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls are not great and bring the album down just a bit. if push came to shove i guess i would have to say i love the way this album ends - the last three songs are so amazingly good. if you are thinking about getting this you need to realize this has more of a prog feel than the bends or their later albums so although it clearly fits in with their nineties work it is unique in radioheads catalogue. i love the guitars on this - after this release radiohead would rarely use so much electric guitar in their music. here you have two or three complementary guitar lines along with keyboards and bass and of course vocals and drums so it is a very complex sound. the melodic content on this is just out of this world. this is very depressing too which i also like.,1
when i come from school and i am really tired and want to relax with some music..this one will be sure on my list,1
what more to say? if you have given ok computer your full attention with headphones in the dark and still not been lifted in some way by the experience then you are doing it wrong.,1
the greatest album of all time. people who say this is overrated just do not understand it or have not listened to it enough. fitter happier bad? no it most certainly is not.. you are listening to it wrong.. listen to it again but this time.. invert the lyrics.. so if he says i am fitter happier.. he is really saying i am not fitter and i am sad.. i could go on.. but this album should speak for itself!,1
simply spectacular one of the greatests ever made,1
the bends was very good but did not even come close to preparing us for the record that followed. here you have an excursion into depth this is an album that once you hear it you will never forget it. lyrically it is absolutely magnificent thom yorkes pessimistic pondering is a big part of the effect of ok computer. however the songwriting is second to none. paranoid android is hands down the best song ever written. pace-changing unforgettable and just completely emotionally overwhelming. that is how most of the album works it just overwhelms with feelings that once you are done with it you will not know what hit you. at times it is ghostly exit music riffy airbag dreamy let down or just plain catchy karma police. there are so many different colors to it but you will still struggle to find a more consistent recording. this album is just completely outstanding. you will rarely have such a life-changing chilling listen. it is completely perfect and beautiful in every way. quite possibly the best album ever made.,1
not much to say about this record. it changed my life when i turned 19 and probably many others lives. an emotional tear-jerking piece of art. recommended for people who is having an identity crisis the depressives or simply the ones who love music. life-changing guaranteed.,1
perfection. simple as that my personal favorite tracks are exit music no surprises and subterranean homesick alien this is one of those albums you have to listen too before you die.,1
el mejor album de la historia de la humanidad. punto y aparte. bueno sin contar el requiem de mozart obvio.,1
il rock supera se stesso canzoni dalla vis emotiva infinita narrano di una umanit paranoica prigioniero della tecnologia incapace di rallentare. epocale arte pura,1
this is for those who went through a phase of teenageor otherwise angst. it sort of touches that confusion that comes with growing up and trying to understand the world. you can hear an almost solemn misery in thoms voice. best radiohead album of all time obviously. whether it is the best album differs from person to person,1
definitely not the greatest album of all time. this is a pretty good album for the most part but absurdly overrated. i can think of about....oh i do not know.....like 1000 albums that are better more interesting and feature musicians who are more talented on their respective instruments than these guys. i mean cmon there are that many people who really think this is better than hendrixs electric ladyland the white album the stones let it bleed yess close to the edge floyds wish you were here and animals genesis the lamb lies down on broadway roxy musics for your pleasure king crimsons red van der graaf generators still life santanas caravanserai the cult s love zeppelins physical graffitti bob dylans desire or blood on the tracks the doors st the who is quadrophenia faith no mores angel dust traffics low spark of high heeled boys grateful dead terrapin station miles davis on the corner or tribute to jack johnson.....etc....etc....etc.....really?!!!! once again ok computer is pretty good and one of the best albums of the 90s but very very overrated overall.,1
it took me a few listens for me to appreciate it. first i knew the singles karma police and no surprises then i started enjoying the ballads let down lucky then the hard rockers airbag electioneering subterrean homesick alien then finally i started really enjoying the more unusual stuff paranoid android exit music the turist. now i realize that the album is composed of some of my favorite songs and the only one which i do not enjoy is of course filter happier it is listenable though can be funny too. the album simply archiever in so many ways but more importantly it sounds fresh and really enjoyable. the band is pretty much at their top performance here i had a bit of an issue with the vocals in the last release but here they are just perfect and the guitar does some pretty unique stuff without never compromising the enjoyability. what more can i say? it is simply great song after great song and the closest i have seen to a perfect album. the fact that it lasts for 50 minutes and feels like a short album is another proof of its great value.,1
definition of the western world,1
incredible album every song is perfect and amazing. thom yorkes vocals are excellent in this classic album. without a doubt one of the best albums of all time if not the best. fav. songs exit music let down overral rating 55 brownthoughts goat albums,1
este es un album perfecto por que a mi me gusta el rock. este album se nutre de todo lo bueno que fue la musica desde que se la conoce. utiliza varios elementos increiblemente mezclados en un momento genial para la musica que lo hacen atemporal. creo que la seguidilla exit musiclet downkarma police es suprema nada se le puede igualar. otra segudilla es la genial no surprisesluckya tourist ya de plano cuando el disco entra en su fase art rock final. y otra seguidilla son las experimentales airbagparanoid android con la que inicia un sonido muy futurista anthemics y desequilibrante. es como una muralla que el oyentw debe superar si quiere adentrarse en este disco eso es perfecto. clumbing up the wall es otra barrera inmensa muy superior a la primera que mencione es abrumadora bulliciosacavernosasaca de sis casillas a cualquier oyente pero es ideal si se le viene escuchando desde el primer tema. lo general es que cualquiera le de un skip y que sea quiza la ultima en descubrirse de este disco. extrao que la fantastica polyethylene no haya ingresado o en su otro caso palo alto en el lugar de la facilmente descartable electioneering que a pesar de ser superior al promedio para cualquier disco con gran solo y orquestacion desenfrenada que de hecho aviva el.ok computer en una fase desencajada con fitter happier despues de la gran karma police hubiera quedado de 10. vaya y donde dejaron lift tambien la podian haber incluido aunque logicamente no encajaria en este disco por tener una base the bends. grandes radiohead ya son top n1  y con otros discos de los 2000 en el top ten.,1
who are the radio heads? why have they told their computer it is ok? where are the booty songs? i do not get it no stars,1
absolutely incredible album. the bends may have some better singles but as an album ok computer goes everywhere you could want it too. if you say its a bit depressing then i think you should go listen to some generic shit pop music. outstanding album in every way,1
comparing ok computer with any other album is like comparing a huge aquarium full of life with a flat singlecolored wall of concret. radiohead managed to transform the chaos and dispair of modern life in... beauty and poetry.,1
what makes this album special is that dates back in the late 90s when it still was this fever of the cool britania thing britpop was the most famous genre in....when this album came on in the markets it was....so strange to find an album by a british group talking about modern problems isolationanxietydepressionetc..... the music this is kind of a loose concept album...wath makes the album more interesting with airbag it is kind of a proto-kid a thing because of it is electronic thing that was going to be the principal sound of their next album...with paranoid android android it is like mmmm...a strange distorted agressive version of queens bohemian rhaspody or beatles happiness is a warm gun but this is a great studio achivement because it is 3 songs combined in one and make a song of this type is really a big problem other great thing is the guitars making a great partnership each other making the suspense and tension that is in the song......with subterranean homesick alien.....it is like scape song from the whole albums sound the theremin gives a space kind of thing.....well it is just thing to put close atention to the album regarding it is sound resuming all because i do not like to write so much about something i do not think anyone will read.... the music fells like desesperating depressing thing but it has it is little escapes like with....subterranean homesick alienelectioneeringthe tourist the lyrics it is no susprise that lyrics made some important work in the album because it falls away from the british music scene of 90s consisting about this lyrics talking about modern problems and at the time maybe the album had nothing little special on the themes of their songs but in retrospective if we see how society it is today is the problems cliuwe face in the hard life of people who work in this society with problems in the goverment our own health incluiding mental health like with the problems of anorexia that i think the track fitter happier also kind of deals in the song also the problems with todays technology etc....part of what i can call the legacy of this album it is the fact that deals with many modern problems....problems that are more present today than the year that the album was released..... in conclusion....it is the perfect soundtrack of the todays problems of sciety and what yesterdays was from back then and musically speaking this album it is practically responsible of todays alternative music scene that is in the world so many artists in the world have said about the influence they had in present music and in the music buisness itself it is this what makes the modern alternative music what it is now also it is responsible for exterminate britpop and make it more melancholic post-britpop.....,1
this album restored the faith in the album as art since 1970s. do not get me wrong there were many great albums released in the 80s as well but this one is the only modern abum that can touch the old greats! every song is constructed gorgeously. as close to a perfect album as you can get. the album does not miss a single beat. even fitter happier has it is place as a sociological statement in this album. it embodies the attitude of the 90s and 2000s in regards to the depression anxiety and apathy of the last 2 decades. a masterpiece!,1
for a while there was sort of a dialectical progression of radiohead albums. up until kid a each album by the group was both a fulfillment of the last album and a departure from it displaying a consistent progression towards greater experimentation with non-rock styles of music. this is still distinctly a rock album unlike the nigh-unclassifiable atmospheric experimentation of kid a. however it is also the first album that displays the sound now associated with the group there were albums by radiohead before it but this was the first radiohead album. aside from its significance as a turning point in radioheads sound it is musically amazing and my favorite radiohead album. the main instrument as with their previous two albums is the guitar which conjures up an admirable range of tones from the simple somber acoustic strumming of exit music to the distorted aggression of paranoid android and the clean chiming lyricism of let down. however the often guitar-oriented sound is augmented with a wide variety of melodies and textures ranging from strings and glockenspiel ? to cut up processed drum loops and electronic effects. the songwriting itself is brilliant varying sharply in mood while consistently conveying the alienation of modern consumer society - this album deals with sociopolitical topics to a greater extent then probably any other radiohead album barring hail to the thief. ultimately this is one of my favorite albums of all time. i could write an entire essay perhaps a book about it but in brief i would say that it is an unparalleled musical experience and perhaps the best rock album i have ever heard. i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates emotionally powerful politically aware music with a wide variety of guitar textures and an experimental touch.,1
do i really need to write something about this piece of art they gave us back in 1997????they let their music speak for themselves.open your ears and just listen one of the best albums of all timeperiod!,1
i have these friends all male who get drunk and then sit around and listen to ok computer. it is the definitive bro album after slints spiderland. they like airbag because they like waiting for paranoid android. when i asked why they do not skip it one of them explained it is like holding in a shit for a few minutes to make it feel better when it finally comes out. what is the part with the weird digital voice? they usually pass out there and i walk home annoyed but some of them stay awake until no surprises.,1
kid a is the better record in my opinion but i will never stop loving this album or this band. overrated? sure. but who gives a crap? whenever i come back to this i think to myself this is it. this will be the listen that will ruin the album forever because you will realize how unimpressive it is. how wrong i am.,1
this is my favorite album of all time. this album changed my from blink 182 fan into a fan of real music.,1
when so many critics put this album in their top 5 for the past 20 years its probably best to listen to them. one thing you can guarantee with a radiohead album is a different and unique sound to any of their other releases. the lyrics of ok computer are pure poetry the like of which i had never heard before. the sounds are raw and unrestrained belying the culture and intelligence in the accompanying words.,1
in the past i have taken out my anger towards this album being overrated come on 1 overall? on the album itself. but after listening to it today i realized it is too good to be blamed for its hype. i understand why so many people consider it the greatest thing ever. it is the crowning achievement of the indie genre. and the song body here is incredible. paranoid android and karma police are the headliners but the electioneering and airbag are just as good. this still is not the greatest album of all time but i have developed a newfound respect for it. rating changed from 4.0 to 4.5 on 72012. this whole review explains why. favorite tracks airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police electioneering climbing up the walls no surprises the tourist,1
while i remember loving this one upon first listen i have to say the fact that it tops the chart as best album on this site has made me revaluate it. certainly there are great things going on in songs like no surprises and airbag but when taken in as a whole the album seems somewhat over valued. i can see it is importance not only in radioheads career but also that of the history of the pop album but i think this just of those albums that the intellectuals like to call masterpieces. again it certainly has a powerful hold but after a while...not so much.,1
this album will bore you. their lyrics are so dry and unappealing but their music saves them. the album showcased their guitar skills and music ability.,1
1-airbag very good but overrated song. 910 2-paranoid android flawless song when i first listened it reminded me of bohemian rhapsody. every second is gorgeous. 1010 3-subterranean homesick alien at first i nearly hate this track because i found nothing special later i got it. artistic guitar work and atmospheric synth melodies great. 910 4-exit music very simple song just a guitar playing the same thing for 4 minutes and vocals. despite this vocalsvocal melodies are perfect. very impressive. 9.510 5-let down alternative rock should be done this way great track. 910 6-karma police weird lyrics great piano melody and creative vocal melodies. strange synths at the end is great excellent song. 9.510 7-fitter happier na 8-electioneering worst track but very entertaining. some brit pop influences... 7.510 9-climbing up the walls one of the best tracks of the band. very atmospheric very psychedelic... simple but superb. 1010 10-no surprises one of my favourite tracks with climbing up the walls and paranoid android in this album just like it simple but superb. 9.510 11-lucky pink floyd guitars on the chorus make this song better very good song. 8.510 12-the tourist one of the two tracks i did not get at first with subterranean homesick alien. now i love it. 9.510 overall 92  masterpiece. the thing is the best album of all time cannot be selected. i mean which genre how? but this is surely one of the best. the ones who do not like the band should accept that they have the talent and creativity.,1
this is an incredible album. the bends was really great but it did not push any boundaries. ok computer is an extraordinary journey and every song works perfectly from the crazy experimental interlude fitter happier to the absolutely mind blowing paranoid android. there are very few conventional songs with simply a verse chorus verse chorus formation. they all build up change in tone there is optimism and despair nothing is boring and everything is exciting. in lucky the lyrics are full of hope but the music tells an entirely different story! there is something interesting to say about every song. some of the highlights that incredible crescendo in exit music for a film thom yorke singing over himself in both paranoid android and let down the lyrics in karma police and the psychodelic ending the equally psychodelic uncontrolled sounding climbing up the walls and finally just the sheer beauty of no surprises!,1
entre los mejores disco que he escuchado en mi vida es perfecto!. no me sorprende que este en el primer lugar.,1
first thing radiohead is not my thing. i have to admit it and differently to most people i have had a long term lovehate story with ok computer mostly hate. for ten years i have not been able to click into this record. i have always known that there is something unique and unusual there but i was unable to honestly like it. it was sometime in 2010 that i got to understand ok computer it is pretentious ambitious over-dramatic many times but in the end it works. you get caught in this atmosphere thom yorke and his band prepared for the record. a little rock a little psychedelic a few drops of pink floyd and you get the ok computer texture. not the best record in music history but my best late discovery and no doubt the one that took me most time.,1
my personal favorite radiohead album with some great lyrics and the vocals with amazing instrumentals! my fav track would be electionering,1
while i do not personally agree that this is the 1 overall album of all time i cannot give it any less than 5 stars because it is truly magnificent. listen and decide for yourself people.,1
i really good album once i finally decided to give it a chance. not the greatest album of all time by a long shot but still a creative alternative rock album. thom yorkes voice grew on me alot at first i could not stand it. my favorite song is let down its so beautifully depressing and the melody is very catchy.,1
i thought it was fabulous. you can smell the influence of cool jazz records particularly miles davis as well as art rock like velvet undergroundbowie. it might just be the best album of the 90s . it is not easy to make something of the scope that radiohead peaks at on this disc. most people think altrock is not very melodic but you can sense sg and the beatles on this. paranoid android is just bohemian rhapsody modernized. come on. not to say that it is not amazing. they are not just idiots with technology at their disposal you can hear really kickin stuff within say karma police like coltrane scales and gracenotes and stuff liek that. i forgot fav songs it has to be a three way tie with android karma police and no surprises. i also really like climbing up the walls lucky and the tourist though. the closing four songs rreally do it for me. i realize that now i am just rambling on so i would like to finish this by saying that it is nothing less than a cornerstone of my library and something that can set a bar for anyone putting out music today. by the way this sounds a lot like dark side of the moon. and although it is fantastic you shud lie down for awhile if you think this is the best album ever.,1
all i will say about ok computer is that its a magical experience. once you realize that the magic is happening to you then is pretty much a thrill ride around your emotions thoughts and memories,1
let us try a little pitchfork thing right here p 1. airbag  10.0 2. paranoid android  10.0 3. subterranean homesick alien  10.0 4. exit music for a film  10.0 5. let down  10.0 6. karma policefitter happier  9.7 7. electioneering  8.9 8. climbing up the walls  9.8 9. no surprises  10.0 10. lucky  9.6 11. the tourist  9.6 average 9.78 rounds off to 9.8. 9.824.9 stars. 4.9 stars rounds off to 5 stars. stars 5 stars rating out of 10 9.810.0 nearly perfect the first question that will come to ones mind when prematurely hearing their debut before it is predecessors is just how in the great blue sky they got from pablo honey to this in four years? my inner-hipster often inhibits me from giving such overrated albums the praise of a 5 star rating but the honest truth it there are rarely albums like this that are able to make you feel so depressed yet happy at the same time. it really sounds crazy but it is true. they were able to make an album that crosses the line of pure technical talent and blends almost perplexedly so the border that separates one emotion from another. there is just something about that feeling of balance between happiness and sorrow that makes you feel grounded in a way that that is hard to describe without sounding insane. it feels like looking at the world in a new light yet still realizing that there is a darkness that surrounds it all. it is full of suspense but never sounds over-dramatic. the complete balance of experimentation and recognizable rock purist antics is most likely the reason its at the top here at rym. its an album that is easy to love and hate at the same time. just an album that is hard to feel too strongly either way since your too busy feeling the album itself. an album that makes the definition of love and hate obsolete and makes the over-complication of life seem trivial the exact second that jonny greenwoods guitar anxiously bends into airbag. it is the record i could see the beatles making if they were still a creative force during the spawn of the digital age. 12  hairy cut 4.5 a record that is filled with tracks so distinct that they cover up any minor flaws that may be present,1
there is no real bias on the rym chart towards this album it deserves to be in the top 10 of best album ever. every song from this album is great to be honest however if i had to choose between kid a and ok computer i would choose kid a simply because of its more atmospheric approach. regardless great album 4.85,1
simplemente uno de los mejores discos de todos los tiempos ah lo tengo peleando con el revolver y el disco blanco de los beatles. intenso detallado toda una experiencia escucharlo con audfonos y smamente melodioso. perfecto de principio a fin.,1
the second disc is really full of songs i can take or leave. essential for any completist but not really fitting in with the rest of the album. honestly i would rate that disc as 3 or 3.5 stars. but this still contains the original ok computer album and that album is fucking amazing. bumps it up to 4.5 as a whole.,1
i went from thinking ok computer was just pretty good to believing that it is a masterpiece after my most recent listen. and i think it is because i finally understand what this album is about definition. being defined by things that you never consider to have very much power over you but ultimately consume you and come to be your signature. your politics your taste in music your neuroses your love lifeeverything that you think is a choice but is not not really. it is 53 minutes of describing what happens when your facebook likes start controlling you and you begin to censor yourself at the behest of unknown enemies people you do not know but whose names you curse and snarl at with all your heart. if only they would show themselves. if only i think being the phrase that most describes the general tone of the album. it kind of stuns me that this album is considered by so many people to be the greatest album of all time not because it is necessarily undeserving but because i had no idea so many people would be able to identify with this kind of self-loathing. because if there is one thing ok computer shows it is that you can never hate anything more than that which is fully intangible.,1
when sitting down to review ok computer i really had to think about what i wanted to say. everything that could ever be said about this album has been said a hundred thousand times more eloquently and effectively than i ever could. but then again if you are affected by a piece of music more specifically a piece of art why should you not feel entitled to express your thoughts about that art? the thing about ok computer it is such a seminal beast in the face of influential and emotional music that it is hard to sum up in a mere review...so i am going to do my best. there is a reason after all that this is the number one ranked album of all time on rate your musics chart. without further ado i give you my thoughts. i was born in the nineties right when radiohead was first becoming the huge international success that they would soon be known as and the legend that their name holds in the industry these days. so yeah i was only about three years old when ok computer was released. i was not there to hear it for the first time like so many others. i was not there to slide the audio cassette of ok computer into my cars cassette player and slowly let my jaw drop as the tidal waves of ambience would so inevitably slide into the ears of millions and infect their musical tastes...and their ideas of music as an art form. with that being said i grew up enjoying a wide variety of music and slowly and assuredly my musical tastes expanded like so many others had. i had my years of discovery where i stumbled ala the linkin park and disturbed days but eventually my ears sought to discover the world beyond the close encapsulated walls of radio rock music...there was something so clich and worn out about much of the music that those stations played that i remember my father drumming along in the car to in my youth. i was a child born of circumstance...and eventually i broke those boundaries and ventured far into the progressive fields of unconventional music. i think the first step i made towards true self-discovery of my actual tastes and of creative artistic music was with nirvanas nevermind. the moment i heard the rawness of those guitars and kurt cobains shattered screams and yells...i was captivated. through the years i gained a foot in the vast array of independent and progressive music that i had so often seen heard or glanced it on the internet. and like many circumstantial children of 90s radio rock i first heard of radiohead with their commercial success creep. even though that song was far from what radiohead truly was and what i had no idea they would come to mean to me later in life i adored it. then through the years i downloaded the bends kid a and ok computer. initially because rolling stone magazine had named kid a as their album of the decade...you see where i was coming from now? with kid a i never truly understood the hype. i thought it was yet another overrated overhyped overindulgent piece of drivel that this music industry seemed to deem art. then again i was only thirteen at the time. but unlike many a peer my age i was not one of the thirteen year olds obsessed with billboard bubblegum pop or marketed cheap sounding hip-hop. bands like nirvana pearl jam and smashing pumpkins helped begin the expansion of my tastes at an early age. it actually was not until a couple of years ago that i was actually genuinely affected by ok computer. i had enjoyed songs like karma police paranoid android and even no surprises to a certain extent. this was before i re-listened to the album to understand its revery and honor in the music world. but upon re-listening to the album for the first time since i downloaded it at the age of thirteen i noticed something. the songs all did seem to carry a cohesive place together. they all seemed to flow into one another. each song was incredibly unique and distinct. i was a little baffled that i had not noticed this before. so after i listened to it for the first time out of sheer curiosity and infatuation i listened to the entire album immediately after having just finished doing so. this time...it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. as if i had some sort of sudden epiphany and realization of what i was actually listening to. i think the moment that i had this sudden realization was when thom yorke goes into that beautiful falsetto on exit music for a film. i realized it was the most beautiful piece of music i had ever heard. i was giddy like a kid in a candy store with unlimited funds. i felt like i could literally reach and out and touch this music physically with my hands. it had such a body to it such a heart such a soul. it was profound and completely enthralling. for the remainder of that listen i was glued to my computer with my headphones a harbinger of lush noises and sounds bouncing around one another in some odd genius perfection. i loved how the band worked together as a cohesive unit allowing each and every member to compliment one another...allowing each and every member their own moments of recognition. i loved the sweeping melodies and incredible arrangements. immediately after i had finished listening i looked up the song lyrics for the album and discovered how deep and meaningful they all were...and how these song lyrics that inhabited each song on the album all tied together with one another on the album to create more or less a story of isolation and alienation of despondence and frustration of disintegration and decay of society but also of beauty romanticism and love of small facets of the world around. after i had finished that listen of ok computer in deep analyzation and contemplation i understood it. i got it. the album the music and its deep intrinsic meanings hit me like a slug to the chest. my world was changed. ok computer in that moment was both life changing and life affirming. it was everything that my tastes had been searching for in an album for so long but had not the slightest clue...and it was right in front of my eyes for the longest time. i discovered that ok computers inception was based upon a deepseated disinterest and disarray from the society around it. it was an album that saw the future ahead of it and bore it like a cataclysmic foreshadowing of sound and destructive emotion. it was kind of like reading fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury for the first time. it just kind of changes you. it enlightens you. it opens your eyes. it shows you how frail and shallow almost everything around you is and how every day the society that everyone seemingly praises is collapsing upon its own self indulgence. i guess i knew that before ok computer came into my life but then again everything just clicked thrice-fold in my brain after having fell in love with this incredible creation. it was an album about insightful introspective and analytical people who could see the rampant problems in society hiding behind the thin veil of plastic smiles and radiant faces. plastic surgery public transport the ideas of love in modern society the fakeness and shallow nature of much of everything around it the strive for progression in technology that was and is slowly tearing society apart on its own seems. these are many of the themes of ok computer. as society strives towards perfecting technology and using its beneficiaries to its advantage it fails to see itself losing its own fragile humanity in the centerfold. and i think that that is much of what ok computer is about as a musical expression and a social statement. it beckons for a return to real raw genuine emotional human qualities and aspects in society. and then you have parts of the album that entail the inevitable descent into paranoia and even further to insanity due to the broken plastic she will that civilization brings on with its lucrative focus on advancement and security rather than maintaining actual human morals and characteristics. i think the album has a lot of commentary on the idea of the android. and more or less i believe radiohead placed the idea of an android or robot into the album so often because it is nothing less than the epitome of everyone that the society in which radiohead illustrates are headed to become. i am paranoid but i am not an android is a perfect example. and maybe with a bit of a subjective analyzation this is pointing towards the idea of human beings that are so obsessed with this dangerous idea of technology that they are slowly turning into these androids controlled by the technology they once sought to use to their benefit. so maybe in the end the message of a song so epic as paranoid android is perhaps its better to be paranoid than to let oneself disintegrate and formulate in the cogs of societys machinery and let oneself become nothing less of an android. the fragile humanity that radiohead so endearingly brings to life are a bunch that believe they are free with all of their advancements in civilization and technology and culture yet they fail to see that it is all a frail mask brought on by the society that is controlling their every action. sound familiar? well radiohead could see the future coming from a million miles away and so they set about using that very destructive technology that they despised so dearly to create this masterpiece that we have today. they wanted to show their listeners and perhaps non-listeners that the freedom everyone held so highly was a blight that was ever-so-steadily playing with fire. even more than that i think that ok computer places a lot of emphasis on a sort of unsatisfied and insightful character...one who sees through all the thin plastic veils of indulgence. i think that the character radiohead are trying to convey with their lyrical depth and their musical tone is someone deeply isolated and alienated from everything and everyone around. he or she is a person that against the wishes of society chooses to maintain their humanity in a time of fleeting values and character. this is where the album becomes not just a prophetic siren song for the future the ensuing 21st century at the time of this records release but also an incredibly relatable emotional personal and intimate summary of someone who feels deep dissatisfaction in their lives. someone who is shattered and broken by their peers and by their environment. someone who is desperately vying to break free from that place of anguish. and i think that is an incredibly relatable theme for many people. it is as if radiohead have this vision of a bruce springsteen born to run type character only set in a futuristic society in a different time and place. i think the album has a lot of commentary on that of introverts and lonely people. wide-eyed emotionally unstable subway sitters and public transport junkies window starer types that embody much of that same isolation and despondence that radiohead seem to feel so intimately connected to. it allows for almost any type of person to access this album and find an immediate connection with it even if they are unfamiliar or turned off by the thought of experimental rock layered with electronics. it is an incredible motif and radiohead do an exceedingly brilliant job at conveying these messages with their even more brilliant musical production. the music itself on ok computer should never be understated. this is not just a beloved album because of its messages about society and its symptoms of isolation and hollowness. there are many other albums that have themes and messages much like ok computer. no what seemingly sets ok computer apart from the other experimental artsy alternative groups in the genre is their masterful attention to detail when it comes to their music and sounds. radiohead are a band that are constantly evolving a band that gets off to the thought of reinvention and challenging their fan base. and with that their entire discography is a constant shift in sounds tones ideas and experimenting. with their debut pablo honey they were met with very mediocre critical acclaim. had they not strived for more and probed their inner-genius then we might be looking back at a band famous for its one-hit-wonder. but instead of simply settling for second rate radiohead went on to produce the bends one of the best guitar rock and alternative-centric albums of the nineties. with that album they blew heads away. critics and fans alike were awe inspired that such a mundane band could go on to craft such a fantastic record. but they did. but even after that radiohead were not satisfied with sticking to one definitive sound and in a shallow way capitalizing upon it like so many other derivative bands have done. instead they understood that to keep their music fresh to keep their music original and to become the influential groundbreaking centerpiece of the music world that they are today they knew that they had to explore new ideas of reinvention and progression. taking cues from other critically acclaimed artists the beatles david bowie pink floyd dj shadow can etc. who had also understood that reinvention and unconventional deviations from the norm are key to progression and originality in music the early ideas for their masterpiece and eventually the worlds masterpiece began. so with ok computer an album that appeared at the helm of the nineties a decade already ruled in original experimental music all of the pieces lined up in perfect symmetry for once almost as if they were to set to fall into such a circumstance. with all of these frustrations and angers all of these feelings of isolation and despondence from this slowly dwindling society they created an album that would go down in history as legend because of all of that existential angst and crisis. thom yorkes howling vocals and beautiful range showcase the albums voice. it is a voice of desperation and disappointment but also a voice drenched in fear and uncertainty of what the future was set to hold. with all of these emotions and all of this artistic vision thom yorke perfectly inclines with the beautiful instrumentation at hand. speaking of the beautiful instrumentation that may just be the albums defining characteristic. because behind all of its deep intellectual and introspective themes and ideas behind all of its layers and cacaphonies there is one thing that ok computer is heralded for more than anything else. and that is its incredible influence on music as a whole. perhaps an album that was released perfectly for its place in the genre. it came trodding along right as britpop was coming to its mighty end and bands like pulp oasis and blur were not producing the same quality records that they once had. it came upon in a time of great musical change both in stylistic approach and in purpose. as it was released in 1997 the musicality that shines through on ok computer was like nothing anyone in the music world had ever heard nor had dreamed could ever work together in an album. the boys who had once released the infamous creep song had no less than redefined a genre of music listeners and music creators in that same decade. even today ok computers influence can be seen far and wide in the industry. bands like coldplay keane and muse owe the entirety of their sound to radiohead. believe it or not back in the day alternative music did not automatically include the use of electronics and synths. this is mainly due to the fact that radiohead had a vision of a different alternative music landscape and so with ok computer they saw their biggest departure from the days of the guitar drums bass repeat cycle. and while that cycle in alternative and rock music is timeless and has always been seminal and most likely always will be radioheads sheer inventive force and insightful originality in their use of electronics working with those classic instruments was spellbinding and awe-inspiring for the music world. little things like this all accumulate to make ok computer the master class of musicianship that it is. and that is without even going into deep detail about johnny greenwoods redefining use of the guitar in alternative music as he creates electronic and synth effects with his sharp skill and honed ability. their sharp and forward thinking use of electronics in tandem with guitar rock helped light a fuse that had just been sparked before by other artists. this fuse exploded and fully took flight in the 21st century. in many ways there were a lot of great albums that take direct creative inspiration and design from ok computer but then again there is a pile brimming with deplorable ones as well. nevertheless one cannot argue the influence that this album has had on modern music. the funny thing is...if asked about how they would be viewed in ten years time before the release of ok computer i am quite positive that radiohead would have never guessed nor could they foresee how encompassing and legendary their names would go down in music history. lastly the songs themselves on ok computer...well they are something else are not they? each and every last song is notable on its own merits as each one is entirely unique. no one song sounds alike to any other song yet they all seem to flow into one another in perfect harmony like the soundtrack to the collapse of a futuristic society...a society that radiohead brings to life that feels not too far off might i add. with each and every song there is a hundred thousand different sounds and the attention to detail is easily conceivable when you play the record for the fourteenth time and are still noticing slight details in the songs. from airbag the opener which is perhaps one of radioheads finest songs on its own merits. the guitar that opens the album is simply jaw dropping and brings a smile to my face. while the lyrics which are intern much darker by all means. i am an interstellar burst. i am back to save the universe. a lot of radioheads music has certain ambiguous qualities to it a.k.a kid a but there is just something about that line that makes me shiver every time i hear it. it is almost like a siren song a mission statement for the album to me. as if the music at hand is actually larger than life and is in place to provide a warning and a calling card all the same for the album. i will not talk about each and every song in detail since this review is already much too long and i have already exhausted expunging my passion and love for this record to the grave. but as the album continues you have paranoid android which is almost the song of the album. it is a song that fully summarizes this album or at least i think so. it has been called by many as radioheads stairway to heaven. that is a statement that i completely disprove considering paranoid android is a song that is leagues ahead of anything led zeppelin ever created. yet i can see why some people would believe that. it has this incredible bending of tempos and structures throughout and all throughout i believe it details the slow descent into paranoia due to societys urgencies and pressures. it is a song about how that paranoia may be more freeing than falling victim to the cycle of conformity that the androids are so inclined to. tracks like exit music for a film which is apparently a song about romeo and juliet prove that radiohead has the ability to craft some of the most haunting music you will ever hear. as it begins slowly and softly and foreshadows something much grimmer it pulls you in only to throw you for a loop towards the end where all hell breaks loose. then you have let down. this is my favorite track on the album. it is just simply perfect. it is one of the most beautiful expressions of disdain and despondence that i have ever heard as we hear thom serenade some of his most tasteful vocals ever over a story of transport motorways and tramlines and in the end how disappointing and depressing it all is. then you have fan favorites such as karma police a haunting tale of censorship and restriction climbing up the walls a headfirst nosedive into a frighteningly realistic take on insanity no surprises a song about the dissatisfaction of day job life and its pressures as well as a testimony about the fake nature of many people in society due to the place of plastic surgery and cosmetics erasing our humanity and then of course there is fitter happier a song that i believe to be criminally underrated. while yes it is not a full-fletched song like the others on the album i believe that the song plays its part perfectly. voiced by an android like character that carries a very unsettling nature fitter happier is more or less a reading of day to day normalities and pressures of modern society and how they all more or less tie together to unhinge ones humanity and turn them into the very android that narrates this unsettling monologue. overall i really cannot think of a short summary for ok computer. because it is an album that deserves so much more than a few words. it is an album that deserves to be praised more and more with every passing year as its sheer influence can be seen far and wide. it is also an album that through all the beautiful instrumentation and innovative use of production has so very much to say. about the modern world about society about the dangers of technology about humanity morality love censorship and further existentialist ideas and thoughts. it is simply the most perfect album that i have ever heard. i know that it is an undying clich to say this but ok computer is my favorite album of all time like so many other people. but in this case this is a clich that works. it is because this album is that damned good. it is so well thought out well made and executed that for anyone to say that it is their favorite album ever made...they have ever right. music owes a lot to radiohead. and so do i as this album opened my eyes like i had never seen before to the bouquets of genres and styles of music at my access. so just for that i would like to thank radiohead...if not for anything else to begin with. no one ever anticipated that in the late nineties the guys who put out creep would go on to produce one of the most widely regarded and critically acclaimed albums ever created...but they did. i do not know if they will ever top it but who knows. it just goes to show that the best things in life truly are not predictable.,1
over-rated but still a really strong album. still on repeat listens it just is not quite up there with the bends. but that is just my opinion. fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls give it a slight sag in the middle. still when it was released it completely blew my mind. perhaps in that light i should have it as a 5 star. so on average track rating  4 star but overall experience  5 star,1
h b... si on mavait dit quun jour je mclaterais  couter lagonie dun gonze enterr vivant...,1
rzeczywicie dziwne jest to e album zajmuje 1. miejsce w oglnym rankingu ale mimo wszystko jest to udany krek radiohead. z pewnoci ich najlepszy. kawaki tj. karma police czy paranoid android to klasyki. nie mona przeoczy te electioneering czy no suprises. indeed the strange thing is that the album is the first place in the overall ranking but nonetheless it is a good radiohead album. certainly their best. cuts such as karma police and paranoid android is a classic. you can not miss it electioneering or no suprises.,1
disco straordinario. un monumento degli anni 90. colonna sonora della vita moderna  alienazione e disagio sottoforma di musica.,1
i generally dislike this band but i figure it is about time i take a listen to this i downloaded it in early 2004 - hey i was busy. anyways this may just be their best album as it seems to be the bridge between the collegiate lite-grunge of their early records the bland period and the alienated electronic moaning of their later records the boring period. let down and no surprises are certainly pretty and paranoid android showcases their dynamics fairly well. the rest ranges from mopey but memorable to hunh?whatthefug. i mean it is not like it is the greatest album of all time or anything wait what?.,1
the soundtrack to life. the thing about this album is it just never wears out. it will still blow you away the 10000th time you listen to it.,1
this one is a grower like almost every radiohead album. it is a piece of musical art that you have to take your time to discover and appreciate fully. when i first wanted to start to listen to radiohead i asked a friend about which album i should pick first and i was handed ok computer. on first listen some songs immediately pleased me - or blew me away - especially paranoid android this multi-parts masterpiece. but what is wonderful about this release is the way it seems to change every time you listen to it revealing more and more of its treasures with each listen. airbag the opener is a great rock song which allows the band to immediately grab your attention... before it surprises you with paranoid android gets you melancholic with exit music thoughtful with karma police let down and no surprises. in my opinion there really is no way you cannot love something on this album. maybe saying it is the best album of all time is a bit too much it has its weaker parts. but it has indeed a lot to offer and deserves its place amongst my favorite albums. i always loved radiohead after that...,1
i like thom yorke he is the kind of guy i would go for a pint with down the local and talk about conspiracy theories to. then he would invite me back to his place for a couple more beers and the rest of the band would come round and he would be all like this is a new song we just wrote no surprises and be like i am not sure i want to bring down the government though thom i just come along for the free beer to be honest and i would edge my way to the door and start running down the street but radiohead would be right behind me playing the opening off airbag on a loop and just be like fuuuuck! eventually they would catch me and make me join a cult where everyone commits suicide.,1
if they took just the first 6 tracks it would be the greatest ep ever made,1
saturated with depressing beauty that captivates listeners. it is musical content is significant and weighs heavily.,1
the only flaw of this album is a white cover. it should be much darker because this is some kind of a musical journey through the cold and lonely night. incredible stuff!,1
i feel stressed quick pass me that computer it might help me with my stress which is in part caused by the seeming epoch of rush and strain ushered in by the advent of the computer oh no the computer reflects who we are as humans in confronting and conflicting ways,1
i cannot lie to myself any more this is a near-perfect album that was highly influential to me. fuck 4.7858558585 out of 5 or whatever i truly feel let us round that son of a bitch up to 5,1
brilliant! they were pioneers of new music back then and still continue to evolve.,1
aussi culte quinspir. un album indmodable tendard dune gnration. dans le top 5 des album des 90s.,1
this album is amazing. the most important of the 90s? i cannot think of any other album with the lyrical impact of this one. the best of all time? why not? ok it is not influential as the beatles albums but it is undeniable that perfection was reached in 11 fitter happier is not a song songs. my favorite part is the falsetto in let down is so god damn beautiful that always makes me cry.,1
the album does not need explaining for it is greatness. the music speaks for itself. but best album of all time? i do not know about that...,1
a 90s classic but if it is the greatest album of all time then i am columbus.,1
upping to a 4.5 because of let down which has got to be one of the best songs.,1
this is now legitimately considered the greatest album of all time. is it better than abbey road and revolver? i am still sticking with yes.,1
as i currently write this this album is now in the number one spot for greatest album of all time. i loved radiohead. saw them in concert. studied all their stuff. i get this feeling about them now like i do the velvet underground and wu tang clan - i feel like i get it now but eventually i will mature musically and fade out of it. well for those of you that have not enjoyed a psychedelic experience it often tends to cleanse my doors of perception so to speak and completely eliminates the pre-concieved notions temporarily that make up our conscious and subconscious judgements. during an experience such as above stated i put on my kid a 10 inch lp and it clicked...again. this time it clicked that these guys may make decent popish- art rockish- stuff to me similar to beatles and pink floyd and other brilliant modern british pop performers in the realms near but below them but they have not pioneered it. ya know? it is good but i do not feel it is groundbreaking like their forefathers. not that this is radioheads fault.. you do not choose when you are born. who knows? if it was released thirty years before i would probably be looking at this hand in hand with the velvet underground  nico.,1
puedo entender el enojo de algunos si bien yo no creo en hacer rankings de musica y no se me va la vida en quien esta primero en tal o cual pagina este disco no me parece corresponda al 1 o con mejor puntaje que cualquiera de los beatles desde 1965 por decir solo un ejemplo sin hacer ninguna comparacin de sonidos que es insostenible. mas alla de ser un excelente album y un clasico de los 90s esta muy sobrevalorado sobre todo por una supuesta originalidad musical que no es tal estando claramente influenciado por el rock progresivo de los 60s y 70s especialmente el krautrock aleman pero bueno ahi esta. por cierto electioneering y climbing up the walls se me hacen mas aburridas cada vez que las escucho de nuevo.,1
it is overated a lot. i enjoyed this for a while. but i do not play this any more nowadays. if we should name this album a masterpiece it should be a time-enduring thing a classic.,1
an album so good that all artists from here on out stopped making good music because they knew they could never match up to it. i mean seriously just every second of it is perfection. except for tracks 78 but we do not talk about them.,1
disco di cui si  detto tutto e troppo divenuto epocale nel giro di pochissimi anni e irrinunciabile sotto ogni punto di vista. non perfetto a mio avviso per qualche lungaggine e una certa disparit di ispirazione tra i pezzi pi eccelsi e gli altri. in ogni caso un manifesto della cultura rock che dice tutto su cosa il rock sia stato e dove sia arrivato alla fine del secolo.,1
it is ok computer !! not one of the radiohead following legions did a very good job ripping off this album because for all of its echoes you hear in alternative rock of the 2000s it still sounds completely unique completely fresh. this is a record where the thinking was not done outside of the box this is a record where the box was fed to a cow and the cows milk tasted like cardboard afterwards so little jimmy poured it down the drain which went into a garburator which fed then into the city water supply causing the sewers to explode. yeahhh. the songs in themselves are all great it is technically brilliant full of electronic strands waiting to be discovered. the first track airbag is about a man surviving a car crash or easily any near-death situation and taking on a new view on life because of it it is just as excitable as it sounds. of course famous paranoid android follows the six minute epic that simply must be heard to be believed. subterranean homesick alien is a nice breather a throughly reverberated daydream. the album flows nicely through to the next two songs exit music and a soaring highlight let down. then we hit karma police the albums centrepiece and arguably one of radioheads crowning achievements the only song that never fails to give me goosebumps with every listen. it has an impeccable buildup the lyrics remind me of a feverish nightmare. in the first verses people are being arrested for opaque reasons up until the protagonist himself is prosecuted frantically trying to save himself. offering no closure the song takes off in an unforgettable climax. in fitter happier we cross over into the darker half of the record. it is a computer reciting a list of positive attributes that could easily come from a self-help book and if you pay attention it is appropriately disturbing. electioneering is really bends flavoured guitar rock as is sometimes suggested one of the weaker tracks on the record but hardly a throwaway. climbing up the walls is the last track before the albums downtempo ending stretch a song written from the viewpoint of a murder or maybe a psychiatric patient with distorted vocals and some gorgeous strings. no surprises is one of the only real modern alienation tracks on ok computer. it is the old story about a character with a throughly soul-draining life in the suburbs with everything anyone would ever want but never really happy. it is not difficult to hear it as being about suicide and the beautiful soothing melody only ends up twisting the knife. one of the most affecting songs here. the only real misstep here is at the very end. lucky continues in the vein of no surprises but despite its optimistic lyrics it is a very sombre song - revealingly it was recorded not long after the bends. it would make a brilliant closer but instead it follows with the tourist a ballad neither as heartrending as lucky and no surprises nor as simply igoodi as karma police or paranoid android. it is not bad but not very interesting either. but that hardly seems to matter when so many great tracks come before. it is not quite the modern alienation album that you have probably heard it summed up as. but it is still great and it is still relatable. and it is as relevant as it was the day it was released. iplease could you stop the noise?i,1
there is little that can be said about radioheads ok computer that has not already been said apart from that fact that i prefer kid a..... 2011 update i am not so sure now!? besides that rate your musics most owned album is a progressive rock masterpiece which oddly enough has never really been considered prog. this aside the unique blend which is radiohead is a pleasure to behold and with the mega hits paranoid android karma police and no surprises the album could do no wrong i openly admit to being a greatest hits junkie. the odd little intermission track fitter happier is the albums only real weakness at first i did not mind this electronic voice preaching at me however several years on it has become more tolerable. i think the albums wide appeal is mainly thanks to the wide ranging fusions of sound with this deluxe collectors addition further tantalising the eardrums with an additional cd of extras including extended sleeve notes.,1
lyrics are interesting like karma police and subterranean homesick alien. the sound reflects late 1990s.,1
if you rate this album anything less than 5 stars you are a dolt that has no clue about music. this album is as close to perfection as you will find it is technically musically and emotionally as good as modern rock gets. not many albums redefine music but ok computer was one of those rare albums an absolute masterpiece. just a pity no one else took up the baton other than radiohead themselves.,1
aprs beaucoup de perplexit et de scepticisme sur la valeur relle de lalbum quon porte tant aux nues ici et ailleurs je dirai au final quil est trs fort et trs cratif tout senchane avec une fluidit magnifique et une intensit constante dans la rvolte le et chant le cri intrieur on est transport dans de hautes sphres musicales morales et artistiques... nanmoins deux morceaux sur 12 do not le bruyant electioneering empche de le qualifier de chef doeuvre et lui attribuer 5 toiles. pour lheure et pour ma part,1
perhaps the biggest masterpiece to be written. this album will still be listened to in year 3000. this is our generations dark side of the moon. no doubt about it!,1
absolute masterpiece though surprisingly i like hail to the thief even a bit more.,1
airbag - drawn out and mostly interesting in the brief vocal-less section near the end. 2.55 paranoid android - after the slow start this picks up considerably and keeps the soundscape a lot more interesting with more variety and effort thrown in. 4.55 subterranean homesick alien - another of the drawn out ones but better executed then airbag by far. 45 exit music for a film - musicianship here is excellent and shines out over the other tracks thus far by miles. 55 let down - more of the same old radiohead sound. nothing special to write home about. 3.55 karma police - the best song on the album and possibly in radioheads discography. 55 fitter happier - filler. 0.55 electioneering - a nice faster paced number to wake us up after the filler. 45 climbing up the walls - sort of shoegazey in a jamc style way. lots of texture which stands out from the usual sparseness 4.55 no surprises - back to thom being mopey with an oddly cheery pianoxylophone stuff going on the background. it is one of the albums shorter cuts which helps it a lot. 3.55 lucky - though not offensive overly repetitive and drawn out. 35 the tourist - back to the drawn out mopeyness and without anything interesting in the music to take away from it. 25 so overall a 3.5 which i will bump to a 4 since the 0.5 was a filler interlude. a few great songs but mixed amidst generic stuff and some outright boring tracks.,1
wytumaczy mi kto o co kurwa chodzi z tym pierwszym miejscem list wszelakich?,1
apart from fitter happier which is an instant skip this album is fantastic and a must buy. paranoid android let down and no surprises are masterpieces.,1
il y a une chose que je ne comprend pas. ok computer est considr comme le meilleur album de tous les temps par les membres du site mais les membres de site naiment pas trop achtung baby de u2. lun date de 1991 et il est sign par un groupe qui a mauvaise presse depuis 20 ans et lautre date de 1997 et il est sign par un groupe qui a bonne presse. puisquon parle de ok computer ici lalbum est bon mlancolique - ce qui fait quil est ennuyeux et pousserai au suicide aprs une coute trop rpte - moderne avec ces petits bidouillages fait sur un ... ordinateur. electionneering - qui pour le coup sonne u2 au fond la gomme - est surement la chanson qui dpote le plus celle qui ressemble  du rock vous savez le truc avec des couilles et du cambouis de partout. a couter  aimer mais surement pas  mettre sur la premire marche du podium.,1
man nehme die alchemie der plattenindustrie 1. wir suchen einen schlagzeuger glatze weil haarwuchs biologisch eingestellt hchstens anstze von fusselhaar dabei kaum dreiig jahre alt. 2. ein bassist hackfresse optisch ansonsten unauffllig. 3. einen wirrkopf mit ebenso wirrer frisur fr gitarren und tasten unmgliche krperhaltung exzentrischer i am kleinen zeh als der rest der welt. 4. noch einen gitarristen mindestens schnling weil gene hier freundlich gesinnt doch ebenso mindestens schchterner weggucker introvertiert. 5. den frontmann niedergebrannte robert-smith-rattenfrisur zwischen blond und hexenrot ein auge kaputt linkisches verhalten unfreundlicher als der sheriff von nottingham weltenhasser. die schickt man in die welt lt sie platten aufnehmen konzerte geben videos etc. und badet derweil in der kohle die dieser wanderzirkus der skurrilitt einspielt. eigentlich unglaublich aber wie sollte man den erfolg der band radiohead ansonsten erklren. vielleicht liegt es auch an der qualitt der musik? diese scheibe beginnt so verhalten. thom yorke droht zrtlich i am back to save the universe dazu rumpelt die band einher in kurioser rhythmik. doch die phil-collins-fans sind schon entgeistert. 30 milliarden potentieller kunden weltallweit verschreckt huch. und dennoch ist da dieser aufkleber auf der schachtel no. 1 uk. gibt es dort keine collins-fans? oder sind die dort in der minderheit? das uk heimsttte der vernnftigen dieser schmelztiegel aus rmer kelten angeln jten sachsen normannen jamaikanern pakistani indern skinheads etc. wundervoll. und radiohead drehen weiter am rad jetzt gehen sie auf die politik los denn wenn thom yorke dem ungeborene hhner i am hirn rumrasen endlich diktator ist sind manche ihre rbe los. ah endlich ist robespierres nachfolger in sicht die rettung der menschheit heiligheilig. sage keiner da dieser wahnsinn keine methode htte auch die schizophrene bebilderung des cd-booklets folgt einem stummen pfad durchs unterholz des negativum. und dunkler regen fllt aus hchsten hhen zwischen massiver gitarrenlrmerei die meine nerven salbeit und panik kotze und passend yuppiefressen. gott liebt seine kinder heit es. ja sagt sat 1. thom yorke und leo kirch sohn und vater. doch das eher in der tradition des dipus. und zuschlagen wrde er mit sicherheit gerne der thom. in der musik radioheads liegt eine aggression begraben dort knapp unter der oberflche welche die gesamte sogenannte metalszenerie einschmelzen knnte. war eine platte bereits einmal i am wichtigsten markt europas an der pole position auf der den hrern nachgerufen wurde wir hoffen da ihr euch bergebt! so hrt man es am schlu des himmlischen exit music for a film. schimren spiegel schwarze magie! das sind die spielzeuge des radioheads. und je mehr die platte voranschreitet so gewinnt man das gefhl wird alles schlimmer drastischer. und die musik sie frit dein hirn! karma police erscheint eine jamsession von reinhard mey mit den mittleren beatles gewesen zu sein gegen ende erscheint dann acid-knig syd und verteilt lsd  gogo und die musik hebt in bunte farben ab inklusive kunstvollem feedback. und die worte? das mdel mit der hitlerfrisur die thom yorke vllig verrckt macht dafr er ihre party sprengt. this is what you get when you mess with us klarer fall man htte es wissen mssen. aber pfui er hat sich nur einen moment lang nicht i am griff gehabt. zitat. na hier gehts ja dann ab bei zeus dem mchtigen. dazu spielt der wirre das klimperklavier herzzerreiend. drama trnen in meinen augen. nach dieser platte knnen den berhrten hrer viele andere musiken f...n bis der s....z b....g ist. oder anders rum. manierismus allerorten in allen tnen in einer umsetzung die in diesen zeiten ihresgleichen sucht. alles absolut gewollt und gerufen hereinspaziert! wo gibts das sonst noch? mansun? ja vielleicht. weltekel ist auch nur ein acht-buchstaben-wort. wut wut wut ist das motto dieser platte. da die band whrend der aufnahmen beinahe zerbrochen ist nun ist absolut kein wunder. das sie weitermachen schon eher. und das diese scheibe ein hit wurde erklre ich mir nicht mehr mit alchemie sondern damit da unmengen an cd-kufern die reinsten tauben nsse sind die fr solch eine platte meiner meinung nach pro exemplar einen lockeren monatslohn auf den tisch legen mten damit ihnen klar wird mit welchen produkten sie hantieren! oder anders radioheads ok computer ist die arno-schmidt-platte des jahres 1997 gewesen. und ich hoffe da ihr an eurer kotze erstickt! kein zitat.,1
this is indeed the best album of the 90s. all the acclaim that it gathers is justified. highlights for me subterranean homesick alien let down no surprises the tourist,1
as an evolution of a band this is a great step. it drones on a bit in places but overall the concept is sound. highlights for me are paranoid android and karma police. time has definitely improved this for me. i would have rated it 2.5 stars when i heard it after it was released. i can appreciate the more subtle details now.,1
i got this album in 10th grade after my friend told me it was his favorite album ever i hazed it logically because i have an awful personality but the recommendation stuck and the next time i was at barns  nobel i picked it up. my cute little high school brain basically imploded. but because i was a 10th grader i would almost always stop the album at fitter happier. a childs mistake. side two is much more subtle minus electioneering than the dynamic first side but once you digest it and really start feeling out the tracks your bound to have a glop of love be spread out across your self. it is a pretty swell feeling.,1
because of fitter happier and one or two solid tracks i can never consider ok computer a perfect album.,1
ok... what has not been said about this album. it will not be topped anytime soon. unless by radiohead album standouts paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down karma police climbing up the walls lucky,1
not as good and moody as kid a but a hell of an album. it is so epic and complex and layered that it gives me the chills. paranoid android is seriously one of the best singles ever. lucky karma police airbag exit music for a film no surprises and climbing up the walls are also perfect. the rest is just very very very good. almost perfect 4.55,1
fcil uno de los mejores discos de la historia.,1
radiohead in general was not an easy band for me to get into after multiple listens i finally started to get a feel for their musical sound and now i appreciate it. i think it is definetely worth a owning and hearing but like i said most people will not capture it is true value on a first listen. still i do think its over rated only slightly. only because it is ranked higher than in the court of the crimson king.,1
this album made history in 1990s rock music with many single-oriented songs that at the same time are also quite experimental.,1
sempre cagati zero ma sono forti dannazione!,1
good record but kid a is better. every album that came put after 01 owes something to kid a,1
it is not bad but i find myself enjoying albums that rip this one off way more than the album itself. maybe it is just been spoiled by admiration.,1
probably radioheads best. one reviewer said they ripped off muse. i am sure it is the other way around. anyway this is only let down by the slow pace throughout. electioneering trys to break this but it does not work. the rest of the album is pretty good. very good. not something i would play a lot but i will still be playing it when i am old and grey.,1
electioneering is the only song that is not exceptional but it is still pretty damn good.,1
i was a little slow to the radiohead party in that i did not actually own any of their albums until the later 2000s not even when they were huge in high school days. since buying this album i have discovered that it is got some amazing tunes beyond just the singles i knew from it. the opening track for example is my favourite song from the album even though it also has some massive hits that are great songs. it was only around 2010 that i really became obsessed with airbag and realised what i would been missing. radiohead are certainly a band that have mixed it up a fair bit with their releases and i admit i do not own them all yet. i do want to say one thing though - the pumpkins were the first huge band to release a double album for free download online hello machina ii. so radiohead did not do it first okaaaaay? favourite tracks airbag paranoid android exit music for a film karma police no surprises,1
how can this album be overrated? i cannot think of an album that evokes as much emotion combined with haunting melodies and soaring lyric delivery. musically i would not necessarily call it innovative as much as perfectly composed and produced. like other albums in my top 5 e.g. abbey road ziggy stardust the listener gets much more out of the experience by listening to the album as a whole instead of skipping to certain tracks. to me that is the sign of a classic. i do understand how it might not connect with certain people but if you are on this page writing a review of it something got you.,1
this is a very good album all rates or polls or awards dont mean much really is the kings speech the best 2010 movie of the hole planet? thats subjectiveand we dont know so the speech of this beeing the best album of all times is useless it might be a revelation to someone or a very weak record for other human being. here with my 4 stars i can say i like it a lot and that if you like music you should listen to this at least once its a very melancholic album so dont look to party with it but if its your birthday and you are alone and no one has called you you may want to listen to no surprises it will make you feel better or make you want to dissapear again that is subjective. in a partil evaluation this album was quite earthquake in musical and popular terms back in its time and it is considered to be one of the huge albums along with some beatles miles davis and led zeppellin.,1
excelente disco no queda mas que sorprenderse con cada sonido y letra que trae este disco.,1
brilliant songwriting. there is something missing so i could give full five stars. my favourites subterranean homesick alien and karma police.,1
there was a period of time when this was the only thing i listened to. now that the honeymoon period is over i think i can look at it analytically and suggest that for some reason it does not flow right. it has some of my favourite radiohead songs karma police let down climbing up the walls but as a whole it does not feel as epic or even complete as the later radiohead albums.,1
i probably would appreciate ok computer more if it is 1997 or 1998 and i do not know what a kid a is. i see this more as a transition album between the bends and kid a. it is like they knew where they wanted to go but were to scared to go the full way. there are genius moments on it no doubt. the bends had also genius moments. later these moments would become whole songs,1
great radiohead album not my favourite adore kid a   but it contains great songs as paranoid android and the very hopeless let down karma police the outter space experience fitter happier but the rest of the songs are still good.,1
dark side of the moon for the 90s. is that a good or a bad thing? well it all depends if you like grandiose stadium anthems. as for me i like them in small doses but a whole albums worth is draining.,1
after spending most of my teen years listening to mostly hip hop with classic rock and reggae tossed in ok computer drew me into the alternative rock scene of the time. a true modern day classic. they really have their own sound although pink floyd is a definite influence i would guess. swirling guitars experimental production techniques and an original sound very much like progressive rock with shorter songs. the opening bassline on airbag grabs your attention and the music is brilliant throughout. highlights include the eerie climbing up the walls exit music for a film and no surprises. the best song here is probably the best song they ever recorded paranoid android everything great about this album in one perfect song. in the grand scheme a bit overrated because i do not think it is in the the top 10 albums of all time but easily top 25. and far and away the best rock album of the 90s.,1
as sure as eggs is eggs i do agree with kylethecat review  this album is praised too highly overvalued overrated and so on.  this does not deserve to be that high in any ranking. a lot of album are far more valuable that ok computer. but well i would not say this is a bad album neither. i can go through without getting annoyed by the length or the lack of quality in certain songs. the prod in fact is well balanced from energetic rhythm to sorrowful ambiance maybe i exaggerate a bit with the term sorrowful. so for concluding fast this is a fine rock album but not a stand out one that blown up everything and changed the way of thinking the combination of producing beauty of forms harmony and expression of emotions.,1
ive never heard such guitar tones and such innovative guitar work as the ones on ok computer. i can undoubtely say this album have changed my way of playing or thinking about music. i could extend this review and and fill it with praise for many and many lines but why? everything i say someone has said even better than i. so let us sum it up this album deserves all praises that it has been received since its release. ok computer is without doubt a milestone of modern music.,1
if somebody wants to encapsulate the 90s musically visually video clips but not only that easily might be this album. the band blends a lot of things here starting from acoustic guitars to heavy alternative riffs all set in an art rock package. even if they do not like to speak about it this bears an influence of 70s prog as well. they acknowledge the impact of can but the early psychedelia is also detectable climbing up the walls subterranean homesick alien. the amazing production highlights the keyboards the most and the ethereal jingling is an essential to the greatness of this. the lyrics speak about car crash and survivals luck airbag criticism of sentimentality let down alienation in modern british life subterranean homesick alien romeo and juliet exit music health and mental issues and criticism to capitalism and corporate lifestyle fitter happier and various topics of modern day life which are still relevant today. some of the greatest albums ever and a staple of the 90s. greatest songs paranoid android subterranean homesick alien climbing up the walls least great songs fitter happier rating 4.7,1
            - karma police,1
its a pretty good album but quite overrated. i cannot exactly get myself to listen to this over and over again like many other great albums but there are many good songs. as an album however it does not exactly flow for me.,1
karma police is one of the greatest songs of all time! majestic emotive quirky argh!,1
if electioneering and the tourist was not in the album it would be perfect. the rest songs are amazing examples of really great songwriting and inspired musicianship. it is ok. 1 overall? no way.is this a joke?,1
i remember around this time an ex-girlfriend describing this album as commercial rock. not sure whether she was purposely trying to wind me up or she really did believe that radiohead recorded something like this with a surefire daytime radio smash hit foremost in their minds. whatever the case you have to admit there must be easier ways to ensure top ten single success than releasing a mournful 6 and a half minute prog rock opus but tell that to queen! lol ok. maybe it is not half as experimental and ground breaking as alot of pontificating music journos have made out but its still one of the greatest rock albums of the 90s and looking back at that comment my ex made i think it makes sense that we split up.,1
very interesting work of course. but a bit overrated i would say. i believe the later work of radiohead is more interesting but i must admit for 1997 that was major.,1
i love this album why does everyone think it is their best? i do not understand that. it is really good but kid a is best. in fact i prefer a few of their releases to this album. it just was the start of something beautiful that is all.,1
another highly over-rated album still excellent. while i perfer a few radiohead albums to ok computer this one still does a fine job showing off all the bands best qualities. i highly reccomend it to fans of 90s british rock bands like radiohead and blur. radiohead really did become a better band over all once they moved out of britpop territory and went into a more art-rock field. me being an american am much more at home with pixies and velvet underground influenced wierdness than britpop mostly just because i am a stupid yank.,1
a unintentionally conceptual album that i think this is no exaggeration has come to define modern life and all of its paranoia separation and unforgivingness. airbag defines a distinctly modern arrogance born out of strange salvation which is also explored in a cyclic fashion in the tourist. subterranean homesick alien defines loneliness with its yearning guitar tones and now subdued now yearning vocal. exit music defines melancholy transporting a centuries-old tale into the modern age in a dense crush of keyboards and effects. fitter happier which many mistakenly call a throwaway defines the danger of losing oneself in modern distraction and routine. electioneering defines modern politics. climbing up the walls defines the insanity always lurking behind the faade. in fact the entire album is about danger behind a cozy exterior like the carbon-monoxide-laced handshake in no surprises. it bewails modernity yet owes so much of its power to modern sounds and techniques making the complaint more troubling than anything else. even more ironically it is a question which i will happily grapple with for many many more listens.,1
this album has a compelling eeire atmosphere.when it came out i would been playing guitar for 24 years and paranoid android had chord changes that i would never heard before which gives the whole song a dissonance that is both strange and disconcerting.it is also deeply disturbing to hear an outstanding vocalist like thom yorke effectively mumbling his way through the whole record.part of the greatness of this album is that radiohead were never part of the mainstream and like pink floyd there is no way they are ever going to give in to their audiences pre conception of what a radiohead album should sound like.this is both great and original some combination.,1
some tracks were brilliant on this album though others lack radioheads true potential.,1
i have talked my fair share of trash about this album in the past and i have to admit i was wrong. it is a good album it just took a really long time to grow on me. i do not think it is the greatest piece of art created in the 21st century as i once saw a particularly hyperbole prone fan put it but it is good. i think my favorite thing about it is the atmosphere. it has an atmosphere that is surreal melancholy and whimsical sometimes reminding me a little of a 90s alternative version of pink floyd. paranoid android and karma police tend to get regarded as the best songs but i like some of the other songs better than them. it is pretty consistent with the exception of the annoying fitter happier which i always skip and the tourist and electioneering which i find pretty bland. thom yorke has a voice that i cannot quite embrace. it works well on some songs but on others it can be a little annoying and at times feels a bit histrionic to me. the guitar is largely the key to the album for me as the layered guitar parts are really where most of the great atmosphere is coming from.,1
a bit overrated still awesome nonetheless. 1. airbag - 3.55 2. paranoid android - 4.55 3. subterranean homesick alien - 35 4. exit music for a film - 35 5. let down - 55 6. karma police - 4.55 7. fitter happier - 3.55 8. electioneering - 45 9. climbing up the walls - 45 10. no surprises - 45 11. lucky - 3.55 12. the tourist - 45 standouts - paranoid android let down karma police,1
airbag - 4.5 paranoid android - 4.5 subterranean homesick alien - 4 exit music - 4 let down - 4 karma police - 5 fitter happier - 5 electioneering - 5 climbing up the walls - 5 best track no surprises - 5 lucky - 4.5 the tourist - 4.5 overall - 4.58. too inconsistent to be considered the best album of the 90s. still an absolutely epic record regardless. let down is a let down. poorly produced which in turn let us the album down. all the hits are top draw material climbing up the walls is one of the best songs ever recorded. despite electioneering being a great track it is out of place on the album. the tourist is one of the best finishing tracks on any album especially the bell at the end which wraps up this phenomenal record perfectly.,1
excellent album that was the reason i started listening to music. the variety of songs as well as the quality of every track has made it worth playing frequently for 6 years.,1
excellent album all in all. musicianship very solid atmospheric sounds outstanding compositions and one whole track of computer talking. the only complaint is about the vocals. mostly they are brilliant but sometimes it sounds like a lazy mule. on the other hand i would give my other hand to sound like that lazy mule... highly recommended!,1
simply one of the greatest most melodic sublimely written albums of all time! paranoid android rocks and is probably the greatest single alongside bohemian rhapsody! that said the other tracks on this albums reach same highs by very diverse means. exit musics emotional outburst karma cops lyrical irony etc. this album should be mandatory listening to anyone slightly interested in popular music!,1
good album...but very overrated album. i think this album is not better than dark side of the moon or many albums of beatles. and songs in this album are ordinary. but paranoid android is awesome!,1
truly is worth the hype genuinely is that good yadda yadda and on and on. nobody will read this so best memories to this one - age 13 had an online friend on aim who loved it and insisted i hear it and it was sent to me as 128 kbs mp3 attachments in 12 separate gmails and i burned it to a cd and sat there doing nothing but listening to it and thought it was a dumb pink floyd rip-off - when moon shaped pool came out we invited a crew over to hear it on my roommates nice stereo in our attic and that album ended and i go to the restroom and hear airbag begin and think oh christ and walk up there and everyone is got a drink in hand and they are all standing and shouting and we just went from there and i thought yeah it really is that good - solo walk up a hill in a tiny mountain fjord town in norway to this record walking up from below the fog then through it then above it and looking at the whole landscape covered in it with only the tops of mountains poking out this sounds pretentious as fuck but i am leaving it in cus that really was amazing - italy trip 2018. little bench on a cliffside walkway in riomaggiore bottle of wine or two and i think this slipped in between amy winehouse and sinatra. most stars i ever saw in my life - germany trip 2019 last night of the trip park in berlin bottle of wine a bit after sunset overlooking the city again i am sorry fuck i am just fucking saying i took trips by myself for myself and played this album at important memorable times so i could associate it with the experience anyway. it is that good i am sorry it is. what is wrong with everyone agreeing on something for once? can we just have this one album? these songs all have a pretty mood to me despite being varied it is a specific feeling that is unique to just this album a sense of bittersweet optimism perhaps simultaneously sad and uplifting but more than that - it is hard to describe but if you are familiar with it you should know what i mean. i think it breaks for a few minutes with fitter happier and electioneering - am i so bad for skipping those sometimes? - but comes back as strong as ever. let down and no surprises in particular put that tone on the heaviest with their similar guitar parts. this checks all my boxes brilliant songwriting that is easy to sing along to despite enigmatic lyrics masterfully detailed and spacious production practiced musicianship it is all-time level on every front. paranoid android is one of the masterpiece songs in recorded music one which has never failed to leave me in awe. i am glad that so many people love this album and continue to do so.,1
man this is the one album that i did not dig at first. but after multiple play i finally realize that this is a great album. no it is not one of the greatest albums of all time not even in the top 25 not even in my top 5 greatest 90s albums but it is a damn great album. airbag-5 paranoid android-5 best song on here subterranean homesick alien-4.5 one song that i love playing so much exit music-3.5 bit overrated let down-4.5 karma police-4 fitter happier-na electionerring-4.5 climbing up the wall-4 no surprises-5 lucky-4.5 the tourist-4 ave-4.41,1
what is it takes to someone to does not like ok computer? to be a total ass!! i understand these guys who said that this album sucks simply you have a aweful taste of music because only people with level like radiohead people who feels music who enjoy listen to good sounds not just shake their head like an idiot or listen to pop music and crap so i respect the guys who doest like it i feel shame for them. this is one of the greatest albums of history this is one of the greatest bands of history nothing left to say.,1
part of me really does not want to like this album just because of its immense popularity but it annoys me too say that it deserves it. brilliant stuff.,1
overjoyed when this beat revolver to the top spot. this album is really something. each song features the right balance of rock electronica and ambience. the first three tracks are strong efforts the loveable airbag the labyrinthine paranoid android and the space rock subterranean homesick alien. these pass off as standard radiohead. you know the general mix of quirky ideas and twisted melodies that sort of thing that sort of radiohead. however these next three songs are nigh on perfect. exit music for a film is pure heaven a troubled extremely powerful movement with heavy use on dynamics and odd instrument sounds. let down is pure beauty. recorded at 3am in some dead actresss mansion it captures the night time atmosphere completely. imagine waking up in the middle of the night on a motorway and seeing all the lights dancing around in their individual soulful sensations. and karma police is the last of the perfect tunes until you reach no surprises lucky and the tourist. not that any of the other songs are by any means bad despite filler fitter happier each sporting their own similar yet completely unique personalities but it is just the final three are spotless. splash out a bit get the amazing second disc as well if only for polyethylene which is even better than most songs on the first disc.,1
uma obra prima them forma de ode ao cotidiano.  perigoso analisar esse album pois poderia facilmente o limitar. mas se for me referir a ok computer por uma frase seria arte melanclica apocalptica contempornea.,1
some of the bands best work is clearly visible in this album. paranoid android and let down are two of their greatest songs.,1
you know i thought it was a 5 too. but that is because i have not listen to their other works like kid a and amnesiac. do not get me wrong i love this album. but it seemed too rock for me. it really seemed like they wanted to change but their record company did not let them do so so they made it progressive rock.,1
a good album but how anybody can rate it above the bends or pablo honey is beyond me. it is a bit like the elbow phenomenan how can anybody really rate their later albums as better then their first? maybe if they have not listened to them....,1
classique. enough has been said. this is the moodiest album my generation has produced. maybe other than liars drums not dead but nothing compares. the sound is unmatched and cannot be recognized. that is what makes it part of the canon and that is why radiohead are the beatles of my time.,1
is this radioheads best album? that is tough to say. if it is not ok computer it is kid a for completely different reasons ok computer perfected radioheads grandiose rock style while kid a opened vast new musical horizons for them to explore. i will say that ok computer is an easier listen than kid a and an album that you tire of less quickly. the progression of songs is intelligent and focused minus fitter happier i guess. every song is a highlight but if i were to try and name my faves i would say lucky paranoid android airbag exit music.,1
after debuting with the bends album britpop oriented and highly influenced by british invasion bands radiohead peak with ok computer in their first and best foray into indie electronic music. still influenced by later english bands paranoid android was highly inspired in the beatles happiness is a warm gun and even queens bohemian rapsody ok computer set the standard for modern post-mid-90s rock and roll.,1
incredibly beautiful yet also dark and depressing at the same time. lots of raw emotion coming from thom yorke. the guitar work on this album sounds like a modern day electric ladyland in how ahead of its time it was when it came out. the best tracks from the album i thought would probably be paranoid android subterranean homesick alien twisted namepossible weird out there cover of the classic bob dylan song or at least a reference to it lol karma police climbing up the walls lucky and no surprises. so excellent album with a lot of room to grow on you as you listen deeper.,1
one of the best albums of the 90s and probably top 20 of all time. much praise is heaped on it for the concept and the beautiful sonic landscape that unify the tracks but that is all for naught if there is not genuinely good song-writing underneath. ok computer has several great songs. exit music for a film - great. paranoid android - great. subterranean homesick alien - great. lots of artists have spent all their time in the studio meticulously crafting every little sound on their album from waves of distortion to the tiniest little chime but after the third listen you realize that it is just a house of cards. luckily that is not the case here. it is worth the hype.,1
is there anything left to be said about this one? landmark album of the 90s. favorite tracks airbag lucky paranoid android,1
unfortunately rym cannot have a 82 star review. perfect. my favorites 1 airbag 2 paranoid android 3 subterranean homesick alien 4 exit music for a film 5 let down 6 karma police 7 fitter happier 8 electioneering 9 climbing up the walls 10 no surprises 11 lucky 12 the tourist. but especially tracks 12356810 and 12.,1
ranked 1 for 1997  1 overall jesus is this overrated. come on a record with subterranean homesick alien on it is not the best ever. boy is that song dull same with climbing up the walls although it did grow on me. everywhere else is perfect. exit music for a film may be the most underrated song ever and the fisrt couple songs are classic alt songs. let us get to subterranean homesick alien i could write this. come on man mabey the folks who love it would be blown away with the first 2 and forget about this one. karma police is a beatle rip but a good one indeed and electioneering is a hard rock killer. even the tourist is epic. i have to say its overrated again but buy it. buy it.,1
first seven songs and the tourist are top notch. but i feel what is in between are weaker in comparison. electioneering itself takes half a star away for killing the atmosphere and mood the album was setting up. it feels completely out of place here.,1
an amazing album! paranoid android has to be my favorite song. definitely one of the great albums of all time!,1
i have two options 1. omg best album evar yah -- in other words five stars. 2. dude number 2 wat -- in other words one star. with the first option i am a victim of hype. with the second option i am an immature little prick that gives a damn about such things. i just have one question is not music allowed to be beautiful anymore? is anything that does not wail in your ears inoffensive? i am not in a position to ponder such things and if i were to i probably would not care. all i know is this here album is real purrty. five stars.,1
i really like this album... a lot of classic moments here are a little ruined by some boring moments... but with so much good moments inside this is considered a classic that will be kept in my collection forever... wow so many highlights here.. this radiohead guys know what they are doing.. i especiially like karma police no surprisesa perfect song exit music tourist and paranoid android.. and with so many amazing moments an album can be called a classic..,1
       -   !       . !,1
a great great album. although not to be labelled a classic it is indeed a fine example of music that can appeal to diferent tastes and tribes. the vocals are really good and the depressing feel of the album makes it for a nice nocturne experience.,1
one of my all time favorite albums. a perfect example of the alientation in the age of machinery.,1
ah radiohead before they completely went from rock to rockelectronic. these alternative rock pioneers never let down.,1
ok computer works so damn well because it exists in a world that does not seem to work at all. overarching themes of suburban malaise alienation and technology run amok in the most yawn inducing ways notwithstanding this album is simply a collection of twelve incredible songs yes even the spoken word interlude of fitter happier which compresses the above mentioned themes into two succinct minutes. incessant touring and hectic recording schedules forced radiohead to become quick learners at both and all their talent and skill come out in songs like the multi-suite paranoid android the slow-boiling exit music and the u2-conquering lucky. an album that consistently rewards repeat listenings sleigh bells in airbag white noise on climbing up the walls a gorgeous jonny greenwood solo at the end of the tourist thom yorkes singing on let down okc seems no less relevant and powerful twelve years after its release. many of the songs were written on acoustic guitar and simply experimented upon in endless ways onstage and in the studio. it is a testament to the bands ability to be simple and complex at the same time along with lyrics that are similarly ominous and ambiguous. the backlash in some spheres is inevitable but popular music millions of copies sold worldwide has never been this experimental melodic and - dare i say it - fun at the same time.,1
when i first heard ok computer i was completely oblivious to the hype and praise surrounding it i was looking up bands that i had heard of on a review site called wilson and alroy one day and radiohead just happened to pop into my head and this album was the one with the highest ratings. the first few times i listened to the album i was never amazed but i liked it especially climbing up the walls and electioneering. now i can honestly say my relationship with the album is simply strange. every time i give it a score over a 4 i feel like i am overrating it and every time i give it a score under a 4 i feel like i am underrating it. i know every note by heart and yet i feel like i do not fully understand it. it feels like both a concept album and a natural soundtrack to modern life. it is both creepy and energizing exit music for a film yet mellow and relaxing exit music for a film. i get a lot out of this album and yet i never define it as a personal favorite probably because i only listen to it every now and then. when i think about it i really do not understand how i remember every single note it just sounds so familiar and natural. maybe one day i will just go all-out and give it a 4.5,1
ok computer is easily the best record in my collection not that big yet unfortunately. seriously not a weak song on the album with the exception of perhaps fitter happier. especially awesome tracks in my opinion would be airbag paranoid android exit music and lucky. admittely it can be quite depressing at times but if your in the right mood it is great. never have i heard an album that is so ridiculously moving and so musically strong on almost every single track! the lyrics are great too especially on karma police and this is coming from someone who does not usually give a crap about lyrics.,1
this is a really great album and yet somehow my first listen to this was nearly 10 years after its initial release - and from a position of great speculation. i have never been one to test out records that immediately break into the mainstream but this website has been something of an inspiration for good records in the past and so i thought i would try it out. this test paid off and pushed me into a position of great respect for a band which i would have never bothered with otherwise. having owned the bends since my youth i never expected this band would have released an album with such ambition as is revealed on ok computer with each song you can almost feel the will to experiment and grow. the only low point of the album i can highlight is possibly electioneering which is a little too vanilla indie-rock for my liking. otherwise the whole album really does showcase radioheads yearning to expand their horizons in a very interesting way fitter happier is apparently not a crowd pleaser and yet to me it is even further proof of this. top picks of the album? again - hard to choose but i suppose the moments i really enjoy the most happen during paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down and climbing up the walls.,1
no creo que diga nada nuevo de l simplemente que es el mejor disco que tengo.,1
so number 1 on rym? i guess there could be a better choice but having said that ok computer is not bad album on the contrary - it is excellent! i can understand some people does not like it for being over-hyped i guess that is the right term. i have been there in 97 there was too much hype for my taste so i had some aversion towards it. i knew those first two singles which were good but i could not understand the fuss about the album. then a couple months later the radio show that was absent for almost a year was back on the air and on the first show they played ok computer. i was so thrilled the show was back and i recorded the album minus few songs on a cassette and decided to try to listened to it to see is it any good it could not do any harm. after i have listened to it a couple times maybe around five i have got that great feeling when you realize something good is going on and ok computer is beyond those two singles. with subterranean homesick alien the album started to unfold while i started to enjoy it more and more. a month later i have found burnt - so called bulgarian cd at the local store and bought it immediately so i could enjoying it properly. next year or so the album was on my top 10 albums but as the time has passing by it started to be slightly less appealing. large part of it was due to the overplaying it on my player. since then circa 99 i have been playing it significantly less than i used to and album slowly departed my top 10 and later also top 66 albums. today i am listening to it rarely once or twice a year but every time when i am listening to it ok computer reminds me how actually good this album is and how i used to enjoying it. so strong 45 stars is a no-brainer.,1
temas destacados paranoid android let down karma police electioneering climbing up the wall no surprises,1
fitter happier is a bit too long and electioneering is a little generic. the rest is classic rock.,1
classic...blah blah etc etc. do not like subterranean homesick blues and that is the third song so it brings this record down from perfection quickly.,1
discazo! mucha gente dice que despues de the bends se les fue la pinza...para mi radiohead cuenta a partir de este disco...incluso dira que el sonido de ok computer es el nuevo ...nuevo del 97 sonido del rock. es cierto que todo el album excepto airbag tiene una atmosfera bastante deprimente y las letras cuando las comprendes a mi me ha costado hablan sobre la realidad de una forma quiza demasiado cruda. pero eso es lo mejor del disco define la sociedad y a nosotros mismos de una forma asombrosa deprimente pero acertada. lo mejor del disco... evidentemente si le puesto un 5 es porque el disco entero me parece perfecto pero por destacar alguna... paranoid android para mi la mejor de la banda y si te gusta j. greenwood en electrionering se luce.,1
if there was a piece of music that came out of my generation that i would consider a masterpiece it would be ok computer. the unique musical genius from this band shines thorughout the whole album. they are going to be remembered as legends they already got a good start now. all i can say is that it is a classic and is one of my top favorites. recommend it to almost anybody.,1
ok computer simply is the anxious self-important uncertain technologically overwhelmed 1990s. thus wrote a pitchfork critic in an attempt to crystallize the essence of this much lauded record. to me however radioheads musical pinnacle does not sound steeped in a certain decade - twelve years later it works as a great soundtrack to the noughties as well and most probably will continue to have a compelling effect on future generations. i first laid my ears on ok computer in 2005 while being a foot deep in the middle of an appreciation period for old school progressive rock. consequently it was an odd record to listen to at first not overwhelmingly weird or difficult mind you but...modern. i could hear traces of pink floyd which i later found out was a common phenomenon among listeners. still for all the faint pink floyd vibes it most certainly was not art rock in the tried-and-tested 70s fashion. ok computer clearly was a musical animal all on its own drawing from influences yes but in the process creating that rare specimen of a record a piece of work that will resonate across cultural barriers and through the ages. it firmly drew me in listen by listen. it wrapped me in its layered beats in its eery and stirring yet strangely enticing soundscapes mainly created by the rich and imaginative use of guitar textures and their juxtaposition with thom yorkes sweetly lamenting vocals. this music seemingly depressing to many ears out there was and continues to be one of the purest most invigorating emotion-laden musical rides for me. at the risk of sounding like a silly fangirl i will go so far as to say that my inner being seems to ebb and flow to the beat melody and execution of these eleven meticulously crafted songs and no more so than during exit music let down and lucky a chemical reaction if there ever was one... in an attempt to crystallize the essence of one of the greatest records of our time even further than our pitchfork critic at the beginning of this review i will only say this ok computer simply...is.,1
the first album i owned. at an early age the real influence of this album passed me by although i felt i appreciated that what i was hearing was very different to me. the real wave of impact this album caused me was felt about 5 or 6 years after originally acquiring it and oh how it has changed my perspective of music forever.,1
i have listen this album and it still being the best work of radiohead. it represent the beggining of the 21st century.,1
so different from their next album but so good in its own way.,1
fantastic bleak relentless music. it feels like the start of a rock revolution that never happened. full of fresh ideas kick ass guitar and great atmosphere. the first album of the 21st century is how i like to think of it.,1
il ne mrite tout de mme pas la place de deuxime album de tout les temps.,1
well i finally listened to it. the album that is supposedly the greatest or one of album of all time. did it live up to it is hype? unfortunately no. however i will say that this is a very enjoyable album just not worthy of all the 5-star ratings that have been constantly handed to it. the album starts out pretty good with airbag being a rocking opening and then it rolls into paranoid android which is a song that i consider to be one of the greatest in the bands vast catelog. exit music for a film is painfully average until the last minute or so then it becomes epic. it is a shame it could not have been that good throughout the whole song. let down is indeed a bit of a let down but karma police immediately makes up for it. it is such a beutiful song and right up there with fake plastic trees and idioteque as far as being the bands most emotional songs. electioneering is another decent rock song while climbing up the walls and no surprises bring the album to a more mellow sound. the last two songs are also very good with the tourist making an excellent album closer. so there it is. is it the greatest album ever made? absolutely not. is it the genre-defying masterpiece that everyone claims it is. nope still do not think so. but...it is a very good arty rock album even if it is majorly overhyped. personally i think that radiohead really found their mark with kid a and amnesiac but that is just me. 1. airbag - 3.55 2. paranoid android - 55 3. subterranean homesick alien - 3.55 4. exit music for a film - 55 5. let down - 45 6. karma police - 55 7. fitter happier - na 8. electioneering - 45 9. climbing up the walls - 55 10. no surprises - 4.55 11. lucky - 4.55 12. the tourist - 45,1
se them 1997 ainda tinha muita gente que no prestava ateno them cada passo do radiohead a coisa rapidamente mudou com o lanamento de ok computer. um disco indefinvel inquestionvel  um resumo them doze faixas de quase todas as contribuies dadas pela banda inglesa ao rock mundial o que tambm se traduz naquilo que foi copiado por milhares de grupos que tentavam recapturar parte da magia de um lbum nico.  bem verdade que a primeira metade do disco  mais esmagadoramente impressionante do que a segunda o que fica ainda mais evidente pelo fato de esta comear com uma dispensvel faixa de falao que destaca os piores aspectos da tendncia artstica da banda incluindo uma das aberturas de disco mais fodas da histria com a linda airbag e a pica paranoid android declarando pra todo mundo que aqui estava o pice da carreira dos caras. provavelmente o maior mrito do disco  expandir o rock a limites antes impensados sem que a coisa parecesse forada calculada ou fria. ok computer  um daqueles raros casos them que a evoluo sonora de todo um gnero acontece de forma natural quase espontnea dependendo apenas da genialidade de um time de msicos... e nesses casos  verdadeiramente impossvel e intil tentar resistir.,1
definitivamente sobrevaluado excelente disco pero relativamente muuuy sobrevaluado me quedo con the bends y pablo honey,1
simply one of the best albums ever written. for everyone who enjoys it i recommend panikon by grimus ,1
rym makes a big fuss about this one but let us skip the second greatest recording of all times part and get to the point when i simply say i like it. sometimes it gets little arty and pensive but it is passable and after that bend it gets amusing.,1
recommend airbag paranoid android let down karma police climbing the walls and lucky this album has proven to be a grower for me it took me a while to get into it but eventually i did and i realized it is greatness for recreating paranoiddour rock music sort of in the vain of pink floyd. the first time i heard it i did not understand the importance of each track and so fitter happier would often get skipped. but even i notice this track now has a significant place and meaning on the album that cannot be ignored. this is the perfect alienation paranoia of the future album and once one gets in the appropriate mind set it can be damn near impossible to not be awed by it. radiohead simply reinvented a genre of rock music that had almost been forgotten the world over and even now in early 2009 its message of mistrusting technology is still relevant. oh yeah! the music is astoundingly spacey in feel it almost seems unearthly. perhaps it was see subterranean homesick alien.,1
some classic stuff here. one of the top albums of all time? i think not though radioheads following might qualify as one of the most rabid of all time. much as i love about 23 of the tracks here fitter happier and the tourist are really pretty shamefully bad. this might be the last record on which radiohead displays any sort of a sense of humor or even humorous cynicism.,1
this is one of my 5 favourite albums and is probably the defining work of the 90s. this albums is a piece of art in every way especially in the way that the uneducated ear cannot quite listen to the amazing complexity and beautiful singing of thom yorke. the album starts where the bends kind of is rocky and anthemic but at the same time powerful and artistic with airbag also appearing on airbaghow is my driving ep in a slightly different format. it then plunges into what is the unrelenting epic of paranoid android possibly the best song on the album. it then moves sound to a numb pace with subterranean homesick alien and exit music for a film the latter having a haunting twist with yorke singing we hope that you choke. a far less ghostly but still as numb and beautiful track is let down. the track karma police well deserves it is place as one of radioheads top singles a brilliant song that shows electronic experimentation linking with archaic instrumentalism. the neutrality of the song fitter happier eludes to the great genius of radiohead. one of the final reposes of the anthemic side of radiohead is shown in electioneering a classic rock track in an a very 1990s form. climbing up the walls is another one of those numb strange and almost drugged tracks. it then leads to the most beautiful song on the album. some say depressing others say strangely hopeful but it can be agreed it is certainly a lethargic track but nonetheless one of the most amazing songs of the 90s. the mood swings once more to numbness and tiredness. but it can be seen that this time it seems more controlled. lucky moves to one of those notorious jonny greenwood album finishing tracks. the tourist is a smooth beautiful song that has a truly intense feel,1
considered possibly the most important album of the decade. but besides all of that i still liked it. i hold strong loyalties to their previous the bends but this was an incredible follow up to say the least. significant innovations in sound and concept from the start with airbag and it is distorted drums and effects. then the fantastically involved paranoid android became an instant classic radiohead masterpiece as it opens into thom yorkes falsetto verse over the beautifully unique rhythmic atmosphere that this band is so great at instantly screaming into heavy guitars then sailing across an air of beautiful vocals arriving onto a heavy handed closing. a couple of tracks later is maybe the most emotional song the band has ever recorded. exit music is the most incredible portrayal of desperate escape that i have ever heard in music. it is still an event that brings the world to a stand still as it reaches a disturbing heart-wrenching climax in the last section. and of course karma police is a statement from my own soul to the rest of the world i must thank them for saying it so well. the next 3 tracks keep this from being a perfect album for me. the computer generated fitter happier goes on to long electioneering is a loud piece that has little direction and the distorted vocal on climbing the walls spoils the mood set by the other tracks. but then i love the final 3 tracks from the ironic no surprises the atmospheric lucky and the appropriate closer the tourist. it is still tough to rate an albums value even a decade away. but i will agree on the landmark position this one is placed. if it was only more complete then i would launch it to the heights as well.,1
at first time i listened to this album i did not understand why it was so cool... but later listening twice i figured out that this is one of the best albums on my library because it contains such a great variety in each song good lyrics and excelent production work... it is definetly the the dark side of the moon of the 90s... well done radiohead!!!,1
i actually think this is a bit overrated. so why the five star rating? it seems a bit daft but it is the best album of all time talk that gets me. i think there are many better records out there even if this is right up there. still there is no denying this a superbly constructed art rock record that captured its time so perfectly that it did not seem likely they could possibly do it again a mere three years later. ridiculous prog breakdowns in paranoid android stadium classic in the form of karma police and simply tender compositions in the vein of lucky. very talented men at work simply put but still no life-changer for me.,1
i was quite surprised that this was the second highest rated album on rym but at the same time quite glad even if it does not necessarily deserve it. it is probably not the second greatest album of all time but i honestly believe it is not far off. for years too much weight has been put on the great classics of the 60s and 70s and very often deservedly so but nevertheless we are all eager for a new wave of true masterpieces and with the help of mtv and numerous others we just have not seen that in the last 25 years or so. there have been a few great ones some left field classics but even the most balanced critics will agree that the output of amazing music is simply not as high as it once was and there is defenitely not one reason for it and we could be debating why forever. radiohead and in turn ok computer did not start that new wave of masterpieces but if one album should have in the last quarter of a century it is this. i am not going to summarize the music because it is been done so many times before - i will simply say that it is one of the greatest album efforts of all time and it is about time we see more of these. here is to a new generation of rock classics - may it come soon.,1
ok computer creates an atmosphere between melancholy and anger that hits you in the depths of your feelings through their lyrics and melodies. radioheads guitars are full of feelings that instead of seem played by human beings they seem played by aliens. this could only be possible in the 90s. since airbag until the tourist the album is a trip that reflects various themes always searching out the depths of the heart. thom yorkes voice is unique and in conjunction with all the instruments of the band and the album production stands out even more. in addition the booklet that accompanies the album is almost surreal. ok computer born in an era of searching the 90s was the era where rock had found new ways especially with alternative rock. that decade between the dance-pop of the 80s and the garage rock revival n almost indie rock of the 2000s. this means that the alternative rock gets to the top and the award was won by ok computer in 1997. after almost 20 years still it should keep that privilege i hope never be surpassed.,1
i mean ya it is a good album. no surprises is a pretty great song. i have always liked exit music. good album but i really do not like it as much as i used to.,1
i suppose i just do not get this album yet. hopefully i will sometime and i will appreciate it is true genius. hopefully. and when that time comes i will update this review. but right now as it stands i find this album to be very mediocre nothing that special. if you want an amazing radiohead abum listen to the bends. highlights airbag paranoid android exit music karma police,1
one of my favourite albums. fitter happier and electioneering are lesser songs but the other ten are pure genius.,1
review 1213 and sitting at 4.37 from 12915. at this point i do not feel i need to explain why i have this at rated so highly. i do not need to explain that this is radioheads masterpiece an album that touches the lives of everyone that hears it or one of the greatest albums of the 90s or of all time. what i will say is that i think everyone needs to stop reading reviews if you have never heard this album and just listen to it. love it or hate it odds say you will love it i think everyone should hear an album that has so personally touched so many people. go last.fm or whatever you need to do just listen. in the neon sign scrolling up and down i am born again ambition makes you look pretty ugly kicking and squealing gucci little piggy i would tell all my friends but they would never believe they would think that i would finally lost it completely we hope that you choke that you choke i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction hysterical and useless karma police arrest this girl her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill fitter healthier and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics riot shields voodoo economics it is just business open up your skull i will be there climbing up the walls a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal kill me sarah kill me again with love it is going to be a glorious day hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down,1
i cannot believe i have not heard it for 10 years after all this is a masterpiece if do not have this...you would better buy it as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
there is not much i have got left to say about ok computer you know for so many people have rated this album above the moon. it is true it could not be much better. maybe one bad thing i can say about it is that it is a little bit too blue. i guess the bends got enough happiness then. anyways yes the best album of 1990s. favorite songs climbing up the walls the tourist let down,1
album ok. komputer uznawany jest przez wielu jako najlepszy album w historii rocka. nie mog tego powiedzie ja poniewa nie syszathem wszystkich albumw rockowych natomiast mog powiedzie e wraz z jego nastpc czyli kid a jest najlepszym albumem w dyskografii radiohead. bardziej wywaona spowolniona muzyka ze wstawkami elektronicznymi ktre wraz z gitarow dynamik bd podstaw wyjciow wanie do kid a tworzy niesamowity depresyjno-obsesyjny klimat niespotykany wczeniej na poprzednich albumach radiohead. album ok computer is recognize for many people as the best rock album ever. i cannot say that because i did not hear all rock albums but i can say that with next one kid a is the best album in their discography. more weigh slow down music with electronics parts which with guitar dynamic will be basic for the kid a create amazing depressive - obsessive mood which i never meet on previous albums. ps. sorry for my english i am on my way to be better  cb,1
there is something paradoxical about ok computer. the music itself is so good that as far as i am concerned it is more or less perfect yet i do not actually feel very happy about this since the songs and more generally the tone of the album have left me somewhat depressed. because of this i do not know whether or not to recommend it. however there is no doubt in my mind that this is radioheads masterwork and one of the most striking sound environments i have yet to experience. the shear consistency of quality alone is enough to make this an easy purchase. for better or for worse this album is special.,1
the first radiohead album i heard. it influenced me to get into the rest of there music and bands like them. its an anchor of late 90s early 2000s rock and roll. fitter happier is very strange but the computer voice has a sad sort of feeling to it. only radiohead could make a computer have emotion.,1
i do not see any reason why some think this is overrated..... if an album deserves 5 stars that is not overrating it is called common sense!. by the way i owned this and it is a must have.,1
well i decided my old review was far too cheesy because quite simply i cannot describe my love for radiohead not to mention ok computer into words. i can use adjectives such as mind-blowing majestic etc. but still these are pretty mild for the exceptional effort that is ok computer. of course you have heard this all before. but you can hear it again. 1. airbag 55 2. paranoid android 3. subterranean homesick alien 55 4. exit music for a film 5. let down 55 6. karma police 7. fitter happier un-rated 8. electrioneering 35 9. climbing up the walls 55 10. no surprises 11. lucky 12. the tourist average 4.83 1 greatest songs ever 6 cover art great! overall 55. what else is there to give this album?,1
the album to end all albums,1
of course i am not very original in placing this album on the first place but it would appear that such beauty is universally recognized. from the first notes of airbag to the final bell tinkling at the end of the tourist are they connected? this album is a scary yet very very beautiful description of modern life. highlights are the climax of let down which sends shivers down your spine every time you hear it the moment the guitars come shimmering through in the tourist and hell all of it really. you probably all know what i am talking about and if you do not go listen to it until you do!,1
edgy and atmospheric and always on the edge of having their heads disappear up their own backsides radiohead unveil their masterpiece. if only they would stopped here....,1
this album makes me happy to be alive.,1
the atmosphere that emanates from this masterpiece is one of the most intricate dichotomies i have encountered so far depressing yet joyous. the lyrics are overwhelmingly negative singing about computers consuming humanity a narrator repeatedly hoping a character chokes and overwhelmingly desolate loneliness. the music however is consuming and atmospheric like a white cloud that hides reality and creates an alternate and intricate reality. the first dozens listens through this album last fall generally got me depressed but nowadays i find that it sometimes is uplifting even though exit music is one of the saddest songs i have heard in my life. the variety and flow really completes this album. climbing up the walls and let down convey two completely different emotions an most of the songs fit right after another with the exception of electioneering which breaks up the atmosphere for better or for worse.,1
disco che a distanza di anni per quanto mi riguarda non ha perso nulla. la genialit pura di tracce come electioneering paranoid android exit music for a film  l lampante ed evidente appena metto gli auricolari e inizio ad ascoltare. qui dentro c la forza di questo gruppo. una batteria che suona gi stupenda il tocco  quasi jazzistico si sente che la sezione ritmica subir cambiamenti e in qualche modo si arriver da qualche altra parte un giorno non molto lontano. lelettronica i pezzi con le voci modificate e i passaggi quasi jazzavanguardistici sono l pronti ad un uso ancora pi massiccio. ma questo  un disco straordinario anche perch si riesce a dimenticarsi per un attimo che arriveranno anche karma police e no surprises due ballate classiche due pezzi intensi e straordinari. karma police  debitrice di unopening beatlesiana poi va da se che diventi uno dei pezzi cardine degli anni 90 no surprises splendida ninna nanna che concilia gli incubi diciamo. ma cos bella non la ricordavo. e poi ancora the turist climbing up the walls scorrono una dopo laltra e il disco finisce. se la gioca ancora con kid a per lo scettro di disco che pi mi piace e mi convince della squadra di yorke ma  senza ombra di dubbio quello a cui sono pi legato anche perch me li ha fatti conoscere.,1
cet album est un bijou en matire de rock. chaque note de cet album est pense rien nest superflu. pour moi cet album a rvolutionn la face du rock qui se cherchait aprs lexplosion en plein vol du grunge.,1
ok computer is still a great album but it does not match the bends in my opinion. paranoid android and karma police are two of radioheads best songs but the whole album seems a little less exciting than its predecessor. airbag- 810 paranoid android- 1010 subterranean homesick alien-710 karma police-1010 let down-710 exit music-610 the tourist-6.510 fitter happier-310 no suprises-810 lucky-7.510 electioneering-7.510 climbing down the wall-8.510,1
is there a sixth star? better than joshua tree or nevermind. this is the best record since london calling.,1
first a confession ok computer brought me back to rock music. deceived from the spontaneous death of shoegazing my bloody valentine and stone rosess new albums were not coming out lush and curve could not produce a good first album chapterhouse ride happy mondays slowdive catherine wheel and many more were just brain dead the end of the pixiesbreeders the boring supremacy of grunge etc. i met a friend who initiated me to classical music and to the joys of listening to music on a perfoming hi-fi system try tallis spem in alium sang by huelgas ensemble!. why dead can dance when there is the real middle ages? why cocteau twins if classical divas have solid singing technique? any rock experiment was instantly tagged useless and already done better in classical music by that new friend that i must thank because he still had opened my eyes to new kind of music which was after all a crucial event in my life. then a revelation so i discovered ok computer everybody was talking about it and i was curious. the depressive ballads impressed me from the first listening. i even thought that rock music had reached its age of maturity with radiohead ! and it took about 5 more years before classical music left the place slowly but surely to its younger brother rocky. finally the history of rock was a lot more complex rich and vast than i imagined and that would remain the true revelation of the last years.,1
it is pretty brilliant that they have come out with this album especially after the bends that was so brand new and different and such a pioneer while it was filled with very great pop songs and very catchy tunes. i think i only have around 10 albums on ryms all time top albums chart that i actually agree with making into the top 100 but ok computer is definitely one of them. not like all the songs were great on it i mean it definitely has its low points like subterranean homesick alien but you can absolutely forgive those because the album just makes sense in its whole every song has its purpose and its rightful role everything is in its right place muhahaha. so i would not change even these weaker songs on ok computer because it is just good the way it is it is how it is supposed to be. i have a theory that this album managed to be so good because it is exactly on the very thin line that borders kitsch. i mean no one can deny that it is dangerously close to being kitschy just think about the last epic chorus part of karma police or the kind of melodramatic exit music but it never really reaches it it always manages to keep its balance. ok computer is like a perfectly elaborated plan it is endlessly smart and it has every tune and every little sound in its perfect place and yet it does not feel structured in an unnatural or artificial way. in the end i think this is what makes this album so great  so there goes my kitsch-theory. i have another theory about radiohead and their music  or at least the lyrics - being not very personal but i am going to talk about that in my review for kid a not to ruin the mood now. so to summarize it even though i kind of do not really like almost half of the songs on this album i would still agree that this is one of the greatest albums ever and not a lot of records can make me say that.,1
definitely their best album. a perfect balance between the atmosphere of their later albums and their songwriting greatness of their earlier albums. a great gloomy masterpiece.,1
tan solo ver la portada ya me pone.,1
there are times when i listen to a new band and cannot believe what an idiot i have been for never listening to them before. radiohead was one of those bands that i had always heard so much hype about but was not sure why. the few songs i had heard were ok but nothing mind blowing. well how wrong i was. i bought ok computer five or six weeks ago and was blown away. i could not stop listening to this album. i must have listened to paranoid android on my drive to and from work over forty times. the album traveled from my bedroom stereo to my bathroom stereo to my living room stereo to my car stereo to my i-pod for a month. the only thing that got me to stop listening was when i purchased kid a. well i off to continue my radiohead conquest. oh by the way buy this album immediately.,1
if you are a real music fan there is no way in hell you would give this album anything less then 4 stars. i can understand radiohead is not everyone is cup of tea but there is no denying it is a great album. overrated? very much so. just like the white album nevermind and dark sid of the moon are overrated as all hell. but it is a great collection of brilliantly written songs that is all i expect from it. do not expect it to be earth shattering or life changing because it is not and that is where this album gets alot of hatred from....because it was sooooo overhyped. do not believe the bullshit hype listen to the album yourself it is a great album the melodies are catchy as hell which also helps.,1
qu se puede decir nuevo acerca de este lbum? seguramente nada... no solamente una de las mejores producciones de las ltimas decadas sino de la historia de la msica misma.,1
wind back to 1997 and i would have told you that music effectively died circa 1975. sure there has been the odd album that has been impressive but nothing that you would even compare to a physical graffiti who is next dsotm insert classic pre-1975 album here... then one day i hear about this album called ok computer and how its a classic. do not make me laugh...or so i thought. from the first note i hd the same chills i did hearing will not get fooled again on who is next with that synth looping away in the background and a windmilling guitar hovering ready to explode. ok computer is not only new its different and in a good way i might add. the album makes a similar statement about the world as does dsotm like dsotm this is that rare case of something being both critically acclaimed and popular. indeed a rare combination. everyone must own this album - it is that simple.,1
i rarely rate with 5 stars an album. i only do it when it proves really strong through time. this is one of them. i do not think radiohead will make a unique album similar to this. a good amount of drugs is nor enough to make this monumental record. you have to be a great musician. and rediohead reached to the roof of their creativity. if i had to rate these incredible songs i would say that in my opinion the best are paranoid android of course let down karma police and no surprises. these four are magic but the rest are strong too. definately one of the best albums of all times!!!,1
i like this album but it is extremely overrated. when i heard paranoid android before the album was released i had hopes that the rest of the album would consist of other longer more ambitious experimental songs... i hear a band trying to make a difficult album to she would off the britpop skin. it worked. thank god they still do not suck.,1
i am going down the i am flattered that someone wants to know my opinion of the probably? i am sure there is a way of finding out but fucked if i know most reviewed album on earth sorry rym which i know is some peoples entire universe rather than the review my favourite album line. well first off my rating of this rather fine album. 5. duh. i have had the immense pleasure of introducing someone to okc in 2008 as they have never listened to it in it is entirety before then. omg! i hear you say ... were they a 90 b living in a north korean jail or c deaf up until that moment? well none of them. it is kind of shocking to know that some people just never bought or listened to bands like radiohead despite being really nice normal and rational human beings. can you believe it? but such was life when i met my boyfriend guy in 2007. i did not really understand the magnitutde of his radiohead-free existence until i took him along to see them live in june of 2008 having only being playing him in rainbows prior to said gig so he would know the new material. i naively assumed he would know all the older stuff. wrong said very much in a depeche mode style. it was on the way home with me gushing like a 15 year old ardent fan about how amazeing they were that he mentioned it would have been nicer to know more of the songs. ??? you had never heard airbag??? never??? you did not even know there was a radiohead album called ok computer?! wow this meant i had the chance to watch someone as they got to discover for the first time six radiohead albums for the first time without a the long waits between releases and b all the fucking hype apart from my own but of course my hype is better than everyone elses so there. i had to go a bit carefully here of course what with the well known adage of too much of a good thing and before you say it guy is no mae west in the back of my mind and the risk of overkill so over the next year or so i introduced one album at a time allowing them to sink in and be digested and an opinion formed and just generally enjoyed. so here we are a few years later. did i manage to convert a former jacques brel and elbow fan into a radiohead fan? yep. was it me and my teenage enthusiasm or was it the music. both probably. but last week when radiohead announced 2 london gigs guy not only managed to get us tickets but without any suggestion got tickets for both nights. what a stan! and just for the record his favourite is a tie between this and hail to the thief. how is that for an atypical choice? love him.,1
nearest thing to a masterpiece i have heard so far  takes a few listens  but when it clicks it is orgasmic. i highly recommend this.,1
painfully outdated. if i had heard this in 97 i would probably rave about this album but i did not. 3.55,1
are radiohead the beatles of the 90s or are the beatles the radiohead of the 60s? even i do not know what that means. 55,1
hey. this is music for smart people. people who have an attention span of more than 4 songs. sorry if you think i am pretentious but if you think i am sounding that way then you are dumb and just proving my point further. you have to commit to this album. listen to it 139 times even if you hate it. one day it will click and it will be the greatest experience of your musical life. i guarantee that the praise that this album gets will stop people from liking it more than they would if it did not get so much praise. i do not blame them though. it is something they will do sub consciously and have no control over. they have weak minds. not to sound like a broken record and a radiohead fanboy fuck it i am one but this is definitely one of the greatest albums ever created by human beings with blood flowing through their veins. thom is one of the greatest singers ever mr. greenwood is one of the most creative guitarists ever and phil lays it down on drums. colin may look like a raccoon but comes from the same gene pool as jonny so that is rich. the intimacy of the beginning of exit music for a film is great. thanks ed obrien. i could write pages about how good let down is. it maybe the greatest song ever. from the opening guitar notes to the cymbal crashes to the xylophone type notes that occur throughout the song to the line do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel to the build up to the final verse to the final verse to thoms singing on the final verse to the way it follows exit music. it is just so fucking good. so good that they do not even play it live because it can never be recreated the way it is played on the album. i heard someone say once that every song on this album will at one point be your favorite song on the album. one of the most true statements ever spoken. sorry i could go on but i will let you decide for yourself how great this album is. awwwww come on you know we are friends till we die.,1
two good songs do not make a good album. i am not a fan of radiohead but they have better albums.,1
excellent half a star off for a few moments where things that they have put in just do not work,1
i respect this record more as an achievement than as a piece of music if you know what i am saying. sonically it is brilliant. it works together perfectly but you really have to commit to this record everytime you listen to it. it is not just the type of record where you just kind of put on a song you like and then put on another one and sing along at the top of your lungs. there is a unifying theme. this is not the record to put on when you feel like listening to music though. you have to actually like i said commit to listening to this record specifically. favorite tracks airbag paranoid android karma police no surprises,1
this is a bullshit review but i have always associated fitter happier with the opening of gravitys rainbow. so if you feel like trying that out see below ..................................... a screaming comes across the sky. it has happened before but there is nothing to compare it to now. it is too late. the evacuation still proceeds but it is all theatre. there are no lights inside the cars. no lights anywhere. above him lift girders old as an iron queen and glass somewhere far above that would let the light of day through. but it is night. he is afraid of the way the glass will fall--soon--it will be a spectacle the fall of a crystal palace. but coming down in total blackout.......................................... -pynchon,1
this really is the best radiohead album. many fans will throw metaphorical stones at you if you critisize anything about radiohead but i have to admit i do not care that much for kid a or amnesiac. i can recognize that there is a certain brilliance to these albums but that does not mean i ever really want to sit down and listen to them. those are albums for the hardcore fan. this is an album for everyone. no one can deny the beauty of this album. it has a great flow and you can listen to it for years without tiring of it. paranoid android has to fit somewhere in the top 20 best songs ever written. hail to the thief has a number of amazing songs but also a fair number of largely forgettable ones. in rainbows is pleasant from beginning to end but lacks any real knock-out moments. ok computer is nearly all knock-out moments and yet there are still songs that come across as high points exit music for a film no surprises and karma police in addition to the one i would already mentioned. i almost cannot imagine there is a flaw in this album though to be fair there probably are. with kid a i would advice new listeners to be cautious. they may love it. they may hate it. i could recommend this to anyone.,1
ok so maybe this is great. or fucking fantastic. i think i always disliked this band because of 1 the hype which is stupid which is stupid to dislike a band for and 2 hail to the thief which is stupid which is stupid to dislike the rest of their discography for. this album is fucking beautiful. i am going to check out kid a and in rainbows after this.,1
airbag  paranoid android12 subterranean homesick alien12 exit music for a film  let down 12 karma police  fitter happier 12 electioneering  climbing up the walls  no surprises  lucky 12 the tourist average song rating 4.29 i remember being pissed at robert christgau for giving this album a b-...i mean how could he call my favorite album which i considered a peak of emotional catharsis in songwriting emotionally dead? i partially agree...listen to in the aeroplane over the sea...that is emotion. but does that make this work of less significance in terms of sheer emotion? no. hell no. these lyrics are amazing. no seriously i overlooked the lyrics at first. airbag. wow. the lyrics are pretty great despite that the instrumentation is at the forefront. unfortunately many of the songs yorke slurs his clever and great lyrics. many of the noises used sound so different than stuff i have heard before you can tell what radiohead did here was special. revolutionary. how they arranged the album is perfect. weakest songs in the middle strong songs at beginning and end. the weak ones are let down and electioneering but you barely notice being stunned by exit music and no surprises. 12 disjointed events creating one cohesive album about the social paranoia in modern times...wow. this album deserves its spot in the top 10 of all time it is pure bliss.,1
of all the music on this site this album is the greatest of all time? yeah fml.,1
normally when you give the highest of recommendation or praise you will have some explaining to do. the thing is this is radioheads ok computer no explanation needed. generally considered to be the album to end all albums i knew that when i got around to listening to this album i would enjoy it. i came in with some reservations how could an album possibly be all of the things that people are saying about it. not even hearing it i had extremely high expectations up until then i listened to other stuff but this was the top of mt. everest. and so with the highest of expectations i bought this album i was thirteen and while i loved classic rock i had not really expanded my horizons. listening to it it topped the feeling i had listening to dark side of the moon for the first time. it was an explosion of sounds. relaxing at times futuristic while remaining down to earth. i felt like i was in deep space nine listening to subterranean homesick alien soo out of this world but earthy at the same time if that makes sense. i did not measure the future albums i listened to against ok computer because it would be unfair. in terms of albums there is ok computer and then the rest of  them.,1
it is alright. this is supposedly the best album ever by some people i do not really see why. it is really well produced and flows really well but i just do not listen to it that much. kind of cold and sterile.,1
radiohead have almost always for one reason or another left a bad taste in my mouth. i have referred to them as pretentious overrated grating directionless etc. and probably much worse. yet now i find myself praising an album of theirs as highly as possible. in nearly every capacity ok computer is drastically different from the radiohead albums that came after it. the song structure is tight and neat. it is really the only record of theirs you can even call progressive or experimental as everything since has relied on little or no songwriting craft to then build upon sonically. the atmosphere is warmer and more comfortable than the barren digital wasteland of a record like kid a or the psychedelic disorientation of in rainbows and the songs are more accesible. one of my biggest gripes against radiohead is thom yorkes singing. on their more recent albums he spends too much time trying to create and control tension with the shapeshifting uber-falsetto that has become his trademark. this is foolish when you have johnny greenwood in your band. his guitar performances on this album are unforgettable. he is subtle when yorkes vocals are driving the songs but cranks up the fuzz and gets nasty as the groove breaks down. lyrically it is less ambiguous which i like although the music alone is so good that yorke could be singing anything and it would not matter. i find him unintelligible most of the time anyway. i have have harbored a deep prejudice against this band for a long while but even this cannot prevent me from being profoundly impressed with the music here. it is a phenomenal experience which is hard to describe. best track electioneering,1
i knew this album was never going to live up my expectations. with the reputation this thing has you would expect it to reveal the meaning of life give you fail proof advice as to how to make you a billionaire and cure cancer. i knew it could never be as good as that. so i went in looking for something extraordinary expecting to find something disappointing. i did not really end up disappointed and ended up with very nice bits. i will take that. ok computer is about three quarters a great album. there are a number of tracks i find rather impressive. this album manages to convey a cold and alien feeling yet somehow is very relateable. this is really well exemplified from the get go. airbag and paranoid android flow well and have a brooding sound of keyboards and occasional guitar flourish to make it all come together. very smooth ok computer is a very dreamy album. i am fond of such flowing tracks like subterranean homesick alien- for something so popular and loved i am amazed at how subtle the whole affair is. if i could only take one to the desert island i would go for no surprises though my issues come from deviations from this sound. it is all about the keyboards and they are what carry this mood. whenever the guitars or piano come out full force the album becomes exponentially worse usually. exit music for a film is horribly boring for example and karma police is a non event. other than those instances i do not find much to complain about and electioneering is an exception to that statement- it is very energetic and wakes the listener back up. i am happy with this purchase. while not among my all times favorites ok computer is the kind of album i can see people getting exited about. it is influence is apprent in todays alternativeindie crowd and with a few listens it is not hard to see why. i am looking forward to trying out more from radiohead.,1
i finally got around to buying this recently. my brother has owned it for years so i would heard it often enough but never seemed to be in the mood to buy it when looking for new cds. until a few weeks back. and i am definitely glad i finally got around to it. it was on quite high rotation for the first couple of weeks but that has lessened a fair bit since. is it the best album ever? no and it is not even in my top ten or possibly my top 20. but it is a really good album. fitter happier is the one weak track and it is not that the idea of the song is bad or even necessarily the execution more that it just does not seem to fit the way it is placed in the album. there are some fantastic songs on here - my favourites being subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film and electioneering - and lots of very good songs. but radiohead are not saviours of the music world. a great band and a great album yes and worth owning but that is it - no more no less.,1
i hate to be just another one of many people giving this album a 5 but it deserves it. this album flows perfectly well with the exception of subterranean homesick alien which i occasionally skip but songs like exit music climbing up the walls and no surprises make this the best album of the 90s without a shadow of a doubt. this album is filled with paranoia fitter happier paranoid android sadness let down no surprises but always seems to have genuine emotion infused into the music and lyrics which definitely is not easy to accomplish especially as radiohead did it it here.,1

there are twenty years to go and twenty ways to know who will wear who will wear the hat? there are twenty years to go and many friends i know enjoy the ride some may hold the rose some hold the rope that is the end and that is the start of it that is the whole and that is the part of it thats the high and that is the heart of it that is the long and that is the short of it that is the best and that is the test in it that is the doubt the doubt the trust in it that is the sight and that is the sound of it that is the gift and that is the trick in it concentrate on more than meets the eye for you are the truth not i.,1
as great as the bends was ok computer is where radiohead really became radiohead. this is a band that constantly reinvents itself and to depart so drastically from proven success this early in a bands life is rare. oh and this album is actually great in its own right.,1
bleak haunting and beautiful.,1
well are not this an amazing album!!! freaking love it from beginning to end the direction they took with this album after their previous two which i completely love as well was one for the better clearly leading the bands musical minds into writing the classic records that followed this one. it was the branch from more of a brit popalternative rock band to more of a progressive electronic band. this album began the journey of amazing sounds and mind sapping ingenuity that makes radiohead such an amazing contemporary band. a true landmark in terms of the bands musical direction and freedom to break free of the chains of the conventional sounds that were occurring at the time. in truth i have not really thought of this album as being any near better or more creative than there other albums which have all been amazing with great consistency much to the likes of that of the beatles collection of records. still it is classic radiohead and therefore mindbogglingly good.,1
the best album from the 90s until now the one who made the rock revolution of the last years,1
horrifying lyrics. endlessly listen-able music. a sonic surprise even on the 1000th listen.,1
clean up time. 250809 this is basically what millions of people have defined as the greatest album ever recorded. no such thing at least not on my book. nevertheless i still love it. ok computer is the experimental turn radiohead took in their career and flat-out reinvented their whole way of writing and performing music it stands for many important things for everyone listening to this bands music. on a personal note this album along with few others saved my life around 2008 especially the last 4 songs which for me are one of the most beautiful moments in the whole history of music. the tourist is one of those brilliant album closers that just sums up every single emotion and sensation explored all the way through the album. kind of like all apologies by nirvana or inside job by pearl jam. the atmospherics all over these 12 songs are flawless and there is this strange element of unrest beauty and intangible feelings that come to me every time i listen to ok computer. that is what makes it special for me. i cannot really say this is the bands magnum opus however this is easily the record they will be best remembered by in 20 years.,1
one of the most diverses haunting and surprising pieces of music i have ever heard.,1
yay my favourite album of all time by my favourite band of all time is the new number 1 album on rateyourmusic. this album is just fantastic.,1
what can i say about this that has not already been said? nothing probably. here though they take the sound of the bends and digitalised it into something truly staggering but their songwriting is if anything even more impressive. songs like paranoid android show their ambition but its simpler songs in writing if not production like let down and karma police that really impress. and the best bit? it was recorded around the corner from where i live!,1
epic in scope. perfect in execution. the most important album of the 90s.,1
let it first be said neither as good nor as important a record as the bends. and the same can be said with the follow up kid a in mind. in other words by far the most overrated radiohead album. when that is said and out of the way let it then be said that there is no way ok computer could get less than 4.5 stars which says more about the band that produced this rather than the album itself. they have a hard time doing anything wrong.,1
blev jo i en eller anden stor kring udnvnt til sidste rtusindes ?! bedste album. og der skal ikke herske tvivl om at jeg synes det er rigtig godt. jeg er isr vild med nummeret no surprises.,1
except for electioneering and the tourist that i really have to skip each time i love it  it is emotional it is melancholic the lyrics are witty the music is deep beautiful sad the voice is depressive and bewitching... i cannot put into words all the emotions felt when listening to this album... you are in another world when you listen to them... at least i am...,1
disco enorme. la verdadera catapulta a la fama mundial para radiohead. considerado como uno de los discos ms relevantes en los aos 90 gracias a canciones como karma police no surprises o airbag. una obra maestra de la que por suerte se pueden seguir escuchando actuaciones en directo. ha sido versionado en su totalidad por el grupo easy all stars dando su visin particular de este gran ok computer. imprescindible.,1
changed my musical way of thinking just completely blew me away,1
one of the few albums worth 5 stars. even the weaker tracks subterranean homesick alien electioneering are brilliant. most people will gripe at fitter happier but it is only 2 minutes long and is a decent enough bridge between karma police and electioneering.,1
i loved this when it first came out. in fact it was probably in my all-time top five albums for quite a while. it just has not aged well for me. the tracks that i thought were just pretty good no alams no surpirses electioneering subterrainian homesick alien when it came out are now annoying to me. yeah there are timeless cuts on this exit music lucky climbing up the walls but i cannot seem to listen to this all the way through anymore. thus it is by no means a perfect or even great album. still worth having in a collection but by no means essential.,1
this is one of the few records i can put on and listen to from start to finish without skipping a track. every song just flows together perfectly. personal favorite moments jonnys guitar work on the tourist and paranoid android the outro to karma police colins bassline on airbag,1
es un gran disco uno de los mejores que he escuchado en el ltimo tiempo y creo que puede enmarcarse dentro de los mejores discos de los 90s. se nota la continuidad musical la fluidez y el concepto que pretende transmitir as mismo deja bien en claro el estilo de este grupo ingls que gusta de ir experimentando en su msica de ir evolucionando. en otras palabras podra decir que este es un disco lo suficientemente redondo con un inicio y un final ad hoc un inicio un poco acelerado un final suave y paulatino.,1
strangely i am not that much into radioheads other albums both older or more recent but i love this one. the whole atmosphere is very well put some songs have a really catchy and easy tone but are not cheap pop ballads.,1
cannot believe it took me this long. totally lives up to all the hype.,1
ok computer 1997 i essentially hear three things when i listen to this album. the bends the beatles and something that is just starting to emerge as the experimental radiohead. experimental is in quotations because this is pop music and experimentation involves usually only bringing back old tricks and styles of music from older generations and introducing them to a new generation. but first why does this sound like the bends still? honestly i do not see the jump that much just a different guitar tone. it is not such a bad thing either. i mean apart from a few of the songs relying more on atmosphere and studio-produced noises than the atmosphere of an acoustic rhythm guitar the others are all written in the same style. but these songs are on the whole better. the message is clear that this album is about the decay of the individual in a society becoming more and more distant and coldly electronic. i do not feel the paranoia though and i remain completely unaffected by the message. what is special about the album though is that the message is really an afterthought and the music stands alone as a great accomplishment. this is what mainstream pop should sound like and it was light years behind the independent artists until this album brought it all back to now. after ok computer electronic pop artists started shooting up everywhere in a world where the acoustic alternative poppy ballad or pearl jam song formerly was king. even people who never heard this album were affected in the years to come by its wide impact. but like i said i do not feel the paranoia it is too pretty it is not experimental in the slightest this is what pop music needed. the fact that this is what mainstream music needed is what brings me to my next point the beatles. when the beatles refocused pop music by basing their pop in rock n roll they were huge because they were marketable and lennon was one of a few willing to really sing his face off on twist and shout. what we wanted in the 90s was a refocused mainstream scene. we did not want pearl jam anymore by 97 and nirvana was still ruling the day. the after effects of these bands were disastrous and came in the form of the offspring and blink-182. ok computer made it ok to be a little softer. instead of bringing rock n roll to the front the way the beatles did and they had a ton of help radiohead brought the nursery rhyme ballad and the electronic sound to the mainstream. so what is the difference between the two and why did this album eventually negatively affected the scene? when the beatles refocused pop music they had contemporaries that were very capable. the who the rolling stones the animals the beach boys and bob dylan are just a few. radiohead really has and never had a contemporary to keep them in check. so while we are not as music crazy as the world seemed to be in 65 we still love our pop music and radiohead took the throne no longer as king of pop acts but as supreme ruler. this became the bible. it simply is not that good. though it is very good. the point is sgt. peppers was a great album and everyone copied it but after that was over they moved on. the stones made exile on main st. dylan had 3 great albums at the same time. the who did a whole assortment of things that were completely removed from sgt. peppers. ok computer still rules the world in pop music. we have not had anyone challenge it in any way. this is the reason that i do not like radiohead or part of it anyway. they monotonized pop music for 10 years. i know that is not a word but still i mean come on indie music is now nothing more than a radiohead look-alike contest. of course we are moving away from this album now but damn are we late 10 years?! the third thing is the least important so i have saved it for last. radiohead is becoming modern radiohead on this album. their more experimental side is just a new guitar tone and a slightly modified way of organizing a song to rely more heavily on studio production and percussion. i do not love it i do not hate it i do not buy the message but i do not have to either. there are no actual emotions on this record and there is no paranoia. however taken by itself its still a damn fine record. 810.,1
1997 was an interesting year for music in the sense that the stranglehold of britpop heavyweights blur oasis and pulp ended. their places would be taken by radiohead and the verve as these two seasoned bands would finally achieve mainstream success. radiohead had gained a cult following both in fan circles and in the music press with their sensational album the bends. their only problem now was how to at least equal it. from the minute i heard ok computer my overwhelming emotion was one of slight disappointment and when hearing everyone praising it to the hilt this just added to my frustrations. obviously recreating the bends was not an option for a band so prone to experimentation but the cold emptiness on parts of this album were for me unsatisfying. airbag is a similar opener to planet telex as the scene is set in a seemingly futuristic setting or the next world war to be precise. complete with crashing drums and heavy single-note riffing yorke describes surviving a near fatal car crash and what an interesting opener air bag is. the only slight downside being the studio trickery that consists of numerous stops and starts which affects the songs momentum. my first experience of paranoid android was when returning home after the end of my fifth year exams. when seeing the video on mtv i remember being utterly baffled by what i sawheard and to some extent i still am to this day. yes it is rambling yes it is pretensious and yes the lyrics are all over the place. despite this there are redeeming qualities in the general atmosphere and cohesiveness of it all. for much of this album i could simply state not as good as anything on the bends. it would be easy. however with subterranean homesick alien i find myself thinking just that. a generally sleepy ballad it lacks the emotional depth of anything on the last album and the somewhat geeky subject of extra-terrestrials is not every ones cup of cocoa. jonny greenwoods chiming guitar does to some extent enhance an otherwise ordinary track. exit music for a film despite being a commendable enough effort does sound a bit over dramatic. the theme of escape is set against theatrical style music and is a bit cringeworthy. unfortunately the appropriately titled let down is indeed a let down as yorke tries to convey a snippet of modern day living. sadly it lacks any of the all consuming power of a just or iron lung. on what is the poorest track thus far it features mumbled vocals and a melody very similar to no surprises. try fitting in it is lyrics and you will see what i mean. after some disappointing moments it is good to hear a nice simplistic track like karma police. greenwood ditching his guitar in favour of the electric piano is a gamble which pays off as yorke has great fun with his threatening words. unfortunately fitter happier is next and the less said about this the better. after the chaotic electioneering we reach the massive attack styled climbing up the walls which is an obvious highlight. dark and sinister it features lyrics that should probably merit an asbo. the two most outstanding moments on ok computer come in the shape of no surprises and lucky. the former uses high pitched xylophone notes which work in tandem with ed obriens guitar and this creates a sound simiar to the velvet undergrounds sunday morning. no surprises comes across as a very sad song with an air of resignation to the future that lies in store despite the revolutionary-type line bring down the government. in lucky yorkes theme is of one of positivity despite the mournful sound of the track. pull me out of the aircrash pull me out of the lake he sings. lucky was actually released on the complation album help which was a charity album for the war in the former yugoslavia so perhaps this was a surprise inclusion. sadly ok computer does not end particularly well due to the lacklustre the tourist. obvioulsy another finishing track such as street spirit was unlikely but did they have to provide us with such a lame effort as this? one can only imagine what the misfit teenagers who spent their lives finding solace in the angst-ridden creep must have thought at hearing such a flimsy track as this. ok computer whlle being excellent in places must go down as a disappointing follow up to the bends. as a first album it would have been an excellent way for a new band to introduce themselves but it is the too many lifeless moments on here that are a bit of a let down. i for one am continually perplexed at the high praise this album gains.,1
when i first heard this album i was captivated and drawn into a new passion for the here and now.,1
i cannot find why it is amazing maybe more listens well tell me why the majority of this site has rated it 5 stars but for now it gets 4. it is pretty great music one of the better cds i have heard in the past few months i admit. karma police is the definite stand out of this album it is a great follow up track from the song let down pretty much. is this the only album on this website that has 10000 ratings? radiohead has to be the most popular band on the planet. edit nevermind i understand why this album is so well liked now. it is too hard to explain. this album is just plain amazing.,1
i cannot find the weakness of this record.,1
this is ok computer with pi for emphasis. criminally underrated especially compared to their cult hit amnesiac. yeah ok songs like pulkpull revolving doors and hunting bears get all the attention and radio airplay and two of my personal favorites paranoid android and karma police are always ignored by the mainstream but i do believe that there is a possibility that i might be able to consider fathoming the thought that these songs might just be better. actually i am undecided to which i prefer it is like choosing which of my tits is my favorite. i love all three of them! airbag starts off with a death metal drum beat and quickly descends into beautiful indie space melodies. near the end of the song radiohead starts to do their interpretation of hip-hop complete with turntables. no actually those are guitars but you would never be able to tell! unless you read wut i just wrote  paranoid android is the effects-laden six minute epic of the album. it goes through multiple and equally eargasmic parts until finally the band reeks all havoc and greenwood lays down the final guitar solo. it is so cool! it sounds like the guitar is going through a computer and getting assraped by viruses or something! then we have the intergalactic trip subterranean homesick alien with beautiful spacey sound effects n stuff. when you get to exit music for a film you will start to cry.    why you cryin? becuz...you already heard the 3 best songs on the album. yes unfortunately after subterranean homesick alien nothing else on the album comes close. but that is not to say the rest are bad. in fact they are great. it is just none of them are as good. fitter happier. the people who dislike fitter happier just are not in. in what? rainbows? vaginas? no they certainly are not. in. beneath the cold robotic voice which is used to give the feeling of someone who has to do everything completely scheduled in a way that is almost...i do not know cold and robotic? is a cryptic piano riff and lots of squeaky little noises that will delight the ears of some if they are able to find it! it is hidden! quite well! it is a secret! fitter happier is definitely the most inaccessible free improvisational avantgarde noise tracks that i have ever heard. even more so than such 20th century jazz avangardists as john coltrane and john zorn. climbing up the walls is another goodie with its boggy swampy dissonance exit music for a film is very empty sounding up until the spine-tingling bassline comes in no surprises is also nice and relaxing. electioneering even though sounding like something that could have been on the vastly unsuperior album the bends is actually good for what it is and what it is is simple bouncy britpop. but check that gr1m black metal-eque tremolo riffing around the middle of the song. tr00. i could care less if let down was left off the album. and i do care less. much much fucking less. ok computer is an awe-inspiring journey through space rock that keeps a very modern technological feel through out. 5 starz !1 there. i just wrote a review in all caps lock. wait...what the fuck. dammit that was lowercase. fuck. i wish there was some way to highlight it all and turn it into uppercase. damn...oh well i guess small letters can be pretty avantgarde too.,1
eleven years ago i was nine. i remember my father would drive down from pennsylvania to long island to pick me up to spend time with him. this would happen 3-4 times a year. and on the six hour drive back up to pennsylvania he would play pablo honey maybe like three or four tracks off of it the bends and ok computer constantly. being a nine year old i clearly did not understand the brilliance that was radiohead. but there was always something in thom yorkes voice that would dig inside your chest tapping into your emotions even if you were a nine year old boy. i did not know the name of the band i did not know who they were i just knew the music and his voice. everything was always so distinct and original. i remember hearing yorkes voice during let down for the first time. it made me miss my dad because i never got to see him. and it made me miss my mom because i was leaving her to go away for a while. i started to tear but refused to cry. yorkes voice was cutting straight through me forcing me to actually show emotion. this was my first actual musical discovery. eleven years later i shower this album with so much praise. there is not a single second of it that i would change. this album is one of the most beautiful things released in the past 20 years maybe even more and definitely the best album of the 90s. this album has always worked as a whole for me. from the start of airbag to the end of the tourist it sucks you in with every single subtle sound. it is been eleven years and i still find myself spotting new things happening that i never noticed before. it is one of those albums where words can really do no justice. but this is radioheads masterpiece there magnum opus. astonishing life changing beautiful and challenging. everything a record should be. favorite tracks paranoid android let down karma police no surprises lucky,1
amazing. all of the songs are moving and brilliant.,1
una obra de arte casi perfecta el mejor album de todos los tiempos? me permito decir que si.,1
one of the best albums i own i put this on a par with kid a as radioheads best work. favourite tracks exit music let down the tourist,1
radiohead started with the massive success of their song creep and later with the album the bends but they reached brilliance with their masterpiece album ok computer. they had a hit with the amazing prog-rock single paranoid android and after that karma police and no surprises. this is perhaps the definitive album of the 90s and certainly the best album of 1997. ok computer is a bit of an emotional roller coaster of different styles and sounds that all come together to make something truly memorable. after this album the band would take an entirely new direction but this will always remain their great popprogart rock milestone. as future generations discover radiohead they will no doubt be in awe of what the band did here. 5 stars. my favourite songs are paranoid android let down no surprises and airbag.,1
guess what i like this album its very very good. but number 8th of all time? o god no perhaps the top 100 at a push the top 50 but not 8th. but no matter how low i scored this it wudnt make a difference so i might aswell be honest. it has absolutely make yu shiver songs on it but i will not talk about them cus everyone knows them. i am going to talk about what i think the flaws are no 1 let down- what a pointless song it just seems like its being depressing for the sake of depressing moan moan everyone is dissapointed. no2 is there any need whatsoever for fitter happier the answer is no. no3 where you think they might do a bit of a grand finale to finish it all off nicely they have the pairing of lucky and the tourist which are both amiable songs in their own right but they both seem like the slowest songs in the world and for me this makes the album seem like it kind of peters out with no real closure. that said all these things stacked up only knock half a star off for me which i think shows the quality of the majority of the material here and as a whole it probably deserves legendary status but eighth best of all time when it has quite glaring flaws? hmm......,1
the peak for both radiohead and indie rock. recorded in a victorian mansion formerly property of actress jane seymour using the natural echoes of the different rooms working with electronic textures adding complex rhythmic-patterns and ever-changing song structures evolving lyrically from teenage rage to adulthood resignation and expanding notably their music palette radiohead created an astonishing masterpiece that deals with modern world alienation with an impressive deepness.,1
i used to listen this album everyday during 199798. i learned to play guitar because of it. and i think radiohead brought back the ideal running time of an album with ok computer. so even if i do not listen much to this kind of music now i know it is one of the greatest album from my generation...and that in a way.... it changed my life.,1
this is radioheads turning point. their 1st 2 albums were good especially the bends but showed little of what radiohead has since become namely in my opinion the best band to date. ok comp puts them in a league with the beatles pink floyd  led zeppelin. it shows the diversity of styles from the high energy rock of electioneering to the sweet  beautiful exit music. i would recommend this as a 1st radiohead album if you do not have any yet. their next 2 albums kid a  amnesiac are ultimately better but much less accessible.,1
no se entiende la msica de los 90 sin este lbum. no soy gran fan de los radiohead pero con este disco hicieron historia. fantstico. que qu me falla del disco? realmente no lo s... que es difcil rozar la perfeccin.,1
album45 10 years on this album still sounds like it was produced in the future. an album in a class of its own really is one of the greatest albums ever made easily.,1
i love this album! i was only 6 or 7 when this came out and had yet to really experience my first computer. i remember when my family had its first red macintosh - i used to play some archaic hunting game on the damned machine for hours the first step in appreciating a computer for its entertainment value. over the years computers have come to define many of our human relationships. my family moved to texas because my dad found a job on a computer. my friend makes his living playing videogames on a pc. some of my wildest imaginings were prompted by the deep portals of the internet and through this instrument all of us have been liberated into bloggers artists hackers etc. here we can make our own profession. this review is only available on a computer there is no paper archive no physical treasury. this does not scare me. the mass amounts of information available at our fingertips is necessarily double-edged - a reminder that there is more to discover as well as a warning to turn off the laptop once in a while. my experience on message boards in particular has taught me valuable lessons about the intermediary role of communication its positive and negative effects. essentialy whether i have used the phrase okay computer or not my young adult life has been particularly marked by many different occasions in which i have had to retain some perspective as to the role and function of computers in my life. passions inflamed by people you have never met? it is okay. unsure about how secure your data is? it is okay. lost a a whole cache of irreplaceable photos because of an accidental press of the delete key? it is okay - it is just a computer. i have poured many of my thoughts much of my time and energy into computers. i have learned about them although i do not understand them. i have enjoyed them and resented them. but mostly i have just come to view them as anything else in life - a part of the environment. to me this album is hopeful and inspiring. much has been made of the dissociative and depressing quality of yorkes lyrics. one day i am going to grow wingsa chemical reactionhysterical and useless you are you are perhaps perfectly reflects what i find to be the sort of equanimity of yorkes depressing lyrics. our emotions such as they are are as magnificent as a soaring eagle and as simple and reductive as a chemical reaction. we experience them as flying but the reasons are quite simple quite mundane. i quite like this sort of realization - that the moments that make life most worth living has some sort of basis in my basic function as a human being. even the most amazing moments of life are part of the normal mundane cycles we all tread. i am sorry to talk away from actual music here but this album is about human experience. i am writing from a train losing myself in writing a review listening to this album which at one point meant the world to me. for four years i left the album and radiohead though i have never resented them. coming back to the album i find that i draw much intellectual enjoyment from analyzing it is content whereas before i really just liked the way it sounds. and what would trains buses the metro be like without music? imagine all these rote exercises without headphones without the context of the music we listened to that morning to make it all okay - to slow down that quickening pace of life to a few bars to live in a few measure of music. that is maybe why fitter happier is so haunting - it does not mention music it is sad it is just human actions without intonation or melody. it is a vision of apocalypse surrounded by the rest those musical interpretations that show even the saddest beings find some sort of redemption in sound.,1
pretty hard to find something bad about this album...just listen to it it is pure magic,1
almost perfect. sometimes its hard to make out what thom is saying.,1
in my top 10 albums of all time. radiohead peaked with this album and have since been unable to reach this level of greatness although kid a was damn close.,1
one of the greatest rock albums. ever. the power of electioneering the melody of karma police the disturb of climbing up the walls or the coldness of fitter happier thousands of faces. masterwork!,1
i did not like it very much at first. thom yorkes vocals grated at my nerves and fitter happier was unforgivable. after i would heard the bends and grown quickly to enjoy it i returned to ok computer and began the long process of feeding myself spoonful after spoonful. naturally the taste improved with time but it was not until i began to reassess yorkes voice that the album really began to click. the emotion is extremely raw and the concept certainly allows for the oddity of a track mentioned above to find a logical niche. i love ok computer.,1
a more thorough and detailed reasoning as to why this album garnered the perfect score is on its way but for right now all i have to say is believe the hype,1
this album is absolutely incredible. i completely agree with jazzyjonas in saying that the reason that radiohead is so amazing is that they released this music ahead of their time. the pure genius and the songwriting of thom yorke is incomprehensible. he is an amazing talent. even his solo album was absolutely incredible.,1
you have got pages full of what i think about this album. great. one of the albums that gives musical landmarks to my generation.,1
uno de los albumes clave de la historia. casi 20 aos despus sus letras sobre la alienacin y la sociedad actual no dejan de tener ms y ms fuerza.,1
i love everything on this album. these guys are brilliant. claimed as one of the best albums ever but eh i digress. still amazing,1
perfect desolate and uplifting at the same time. wow i listen to one song this must play through it is entirety. this is an all time classic. i to this all the time.,1
its a great album and among the best from the 90s but not the best. at the top of my head i can think of flaming lips soft bulletin pavements crooked rain crooked rain bjorks homogenic neutral milk hotels in the aeroplane over the sea my bloody valentines loveless magnetic fields 69 love songs and maybe even pulps different class as better albums from the 90s. maybe its because i listened to this album to late after it came out and so many bands nowadays have tried to imitate this sound that it does not seem new to me at all maybe it did back in 97. a lot of the songs are expertly written and played by the band but it sounds too much to me like brit pop meets electronic some times. plus i have already heard amnesiac and hail to thief before listening to this so my view of radiohead was not based on creep and the bends. still highly recomened.,1
although it is critically acclaimed this album will never receive the credit it deserves. not to diss the beatles but any idiot can find something enjoyable about their music. the fact that it requires a semi-intelligent person to appreciate some of radioheads material is what leads to the idiotic hatred of it. it is analogous to people denying evolution simply because they are too lazy to understand it. the polarization this album causes should be even more evidence of its substance. finally something to contrast dumbasses with open-minded people in an art-form.,1
the idea of ok computer on vinyl seems wrong to me. who wants warmness on that album? i love hospital corridors and airport terminals and vomit splattered stairs ascending to hospital airports. this album has created one of my biggest musical regrets. back in 1997 ad i was making fun of my girlfriendmanagerbarristaburrow for wanting this album even though i did appreciate the bends. i am an idiot. such an idiot. such an idiot that the next time i will use the wrong article to show my idiocy. such a idiot.,1
paranoid android is a great song andi love karma police dont know why exactly but i think this album is too much overrated.,1
two weeks after i bought ok computer in 2000 i flew off to study abroad in france for 6 weeks. i had some other americans to hang out with but living with a host family and interacting with plenty of people whose language i could barely speak left me somewhat isolated. maybe that is the reason why i listened to ok computer so often the albums themes of isolation and detachment really spoke to me at the time. for a great deal of music nerds ok computer was the big album of our generation. besides paranoid androids multiple-songs-in-one i have never heard too much experimentation in these songs but all of them are interesting to listen to and emotionally affecting. let down is just plain gorgeous and climbing up the walls is wonderfully creepy. greenwood continued to be radioheads secret weapon and thom yorke wrote the hell out of 11 great songs. there is also fitter happier which is a weak spot of sheer pretension but it is easy to overlook. it is definitely a cliche to love this album but i do anyway. 55,1
awesome. mind-blowing. a perfect piece of 21st century rock which stands among the best albums of the genre.,1
solid album but fairly consistent. radiohead got better after this album.,1
oh god i just gave ok computer a 5 i am officially part of the problem. whatever it is a great album certainly not the greatest in history but well deserving of its high average rating.,1
it amazes me that i have not listen to this album still 2006. when i first popped this into my cd player and airbag came on it was good not great but good. but then paranoid android came on and that changed everything about this album... the lyrics... the singing... the guitar work... the album shot up to my top 100 albums right there on this track... but after subterranean homework alien it shot up to the top 90s... exit musicfor a film it shot up to the top 80s... let down it shot up to the top 60s... the karma police with the help of fitter happier shot it to the top 25... but then something happen electioneering came along with a more rockier sound it did not fit it does not work on this album. the guitar is not catchy the voice work is average at best and the weakest song of this album... climbing up the walls has the same appeal of electioneering it does not fit on this album that well but it works better then electioneering. then this one track no surprises turns around from the last two tracks and become one of the most beloved songs and greatest song of the album and all time even thought not people think of it so... because of this one and only song ok computer jumps to the top 5... and will stay there till the end of time... the last two tracks are just icing on the cake lucky and the tourist. but any of the last three songs could the closer of the album and it would not change a thing about the album at all. this one of the most beautiful albums ever made and one of the greatest ever make... if this could be ranked like this it would be ranked infinity10 of the greatness of what it has.,1
radioheads guitar-driven masterpiece. not as good as kid a but a close second.,1
best album that ever existed. it is the center of everything. it is because me hurt it is caused me happiness it is caused me confusion it is given me a reason to rejoice. it is me in 12 songs.,1
this album moves me enough to review it. this is my first after several years here review and may be my last. i heard reports in fall 1997 of critics i do not know which ones calling this the best album of all time. that was rubbish then as it is now but i had not heard it to that point except karma police. so i went into it with expectations and skepticism which vanished quickly. i really dug it through college but did not listen to it for probably 2005-06. ten years is my personal yardstick for a great albums efficacy i did not have any emotion for inevermindi by 2001 and expected about the same for this. but it sounds fresh now and as prescient and emotionally ranging as others have suggested. this is not my favorite album but it is really special as commercial music goes. i try not to be hyperbolic but if you marked this with less than 3 stars i do not think you like good music now.,1
this album is just fantastic. two albums that are quintessential to the 90s nevermind for the beginning of the decade and ok computer for near the end of it. this album is hard to explain but its impact and just its goodness cannot be ignored. listen to it yourself and see that it just fit for the time it came out in. the world is a better place because of this album. i know it saved lives. its honesty and overall sound was never before and will never be again. one of a kind masterpiece.,1
this is an album of excellent songs. well of course some are more excellent than others but there are not really any bad songs one filler though. radiohead display a fine variety here the first track airbag is a relatively standard rock tune that has been given the distinctive and slightly unnerving thom yorke vibe. in contrast with this we are presented with the schizophrenic paraniod android a truly stunning musical journey. the album follows the tone set by the first two songs occasionally scratching at the excellence of paranoid android but inevitably not exceeding it. this album is simply a must for any rock collection.,1
besides the superb songwriting? well the whole mystery that surrounds ok computer is interesting as well is it a conceptual record? did the protagonist not survive the car crash after all as we may or may not experience from listening to the tourist? is he drumroll a ghost?yes climbing up the walls is the best thing ever written in case you were wondering. key track climbing up the walls 4.83!,1
one of the truely grand musical experiences one would ever dream to take. a final masterwork in every way in every form. if you do not believe me just listen to karma police and well that is all friends! go out and grab it babe!,1
one of my favourite albums. innovative and catchy always moving.,1
best radiohead album to date. it took me a few years and then suddenly it hit me! i got it... paranoid android - classic song... makes me want to bang my head against a wall! karma police - i used to like it but no more climbing up the walls - on of the scariest songs in the world- best radiohead song ever! electioneering - nice song...seems as if it belongs in the bends musically exit music - one of the best songs ever...,1
this album is my bible. this is the first radiohead album i ever heard and consequently why they are my favorite band. it just captures what they are trying to get across so clearly. there is a very clear feel to this album and you feel compassion and caring for the characters within eventually you feel just as claustrophobic as they do. i rarely ever listen to this album without starting at the beginning and listening without interruption to the end. i would give a song-by-song synopsis but i feel that would spoil the album. it takes a good 5-6 listens to appriciate fully but trust me its worth it. and it always will be. a year now and i honestly can say that i will never get tired of it. ever. sometimes i like to take breaks every once and a while just so that when i come back its twice as sweet as before. and i still get the exact same feeling i get listening to airbag as the first time i heard it inside borders at the listening station. and each time i listen to this album it grows more profound,1
what can i say about this? to me ok computer is one of those acclaimed albums that truly deserve the hype. i can hear a lot of effort in each song everything feels complete and accomplished and it looks like it has not aged anything through these years. although there are a few tracks i do not really like at the start airbag subterranean homesick alien and exit music that has become somehow disturbingly melodramatic the others stayed with me and still mean something. lucky is my favourite one climbing up the walls and let down are close behind and i would not say i got bored of songs like paranoid android no surprises or karma police for now either. maybe because of the memories but these songs feel very layered both in production and meaning i think you can still find something new after several listens. and while all of them are quite varied the album has a very special consistent atmosphere and in general it is very relatable and moving. maybe that is the reason why people love this album so much. or it is simply because this is a collection of damn good songs.,1
when i first heard creep i said there is something about this band that i cannot place my finger on it but they sound great.  i went out and bought pablo honey and thought this is not that great an album but they are not a one-hit wonder either. there is some great material here. they came out with the release of my iron lung and i said oh my god rock has been saved. needless to say i was right. and ok computer is the pinnacle of the bands career so far.,1
how do you go about giving a detailed insight into such a critically acclaimed album from possibly the most talked about band ever? you do not. just shut up and get it. do not talk about how amazing you think it is we know already. we know.,1
this is one of those albums that i can actually sit through and listen to every track and not skip any. it is the album that got me into radiohead but certainly not my favorite of theirs.,1
definatly in my top 5. the first radiohead album i really listened to. and karma police was the song that made me love radiohead to begin with.,1
one of the greatest band of 90 and that is their best album. just a masterpiece. every song is special!,1
if the album just stopped after fitter happier it would get a 5.,1
alright...i give up. this is a perfect album. i had it at 4.5 for ages. had a dream about radiohead and listened to it this morning from a new perspective and yes...this is one of the greatest albums ever made. the problem with albums that you have had for a long time is that sometimes they get under your skin and you can no longer be objective about them. fortunately i gained the ability to look at this album freshly again. ok computer is perfect.,1
a very good album no doubt about that it just is not as deep and defining as kid a is hence the 4.5 and not a plain 5.0,1
one of the most creative album ever does not sound dated at all right now 10 years after its release. my words will not do this album justice. some songs might sound boring on its own but put it in context and this is one of the top 5 album of the 90s one of the top 20if not 10 of all time. only downside? fitter happier is about 130 too long,1
the first album i ever bought and i have never regretted it. this album is easily the best album of 1997 and probably the best album of the 1990s. i would also love to say its one of the best albums of all time but that is only in my opinion. this album changed my life and this band is easily my biggest musical influence. every song is different and every song is amazing. highlights for me are let down lucky subterranean homesick alien.,1
i know that it is cliche to give this album five stars seeing as it has been on the top of almost every list of albums from the last 20 years. but i do not care. i can say without hesitation that this record changed my life. while thom and johnny get the most credit i believe that as a whole radiohead has to be the most talented and creative band in existence today.,1
every so often somewhere in the decade an album is released that sets the standard for what and album of that particular genre should consist of. these albums push the boundaries and raise the bar. for the 60s it would be sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band the 70s dark side of the moon the 80s..... well that ones harder possibly the joshua tree by u2. as for the 90s most people narrow it down to nirvanas nevermind and radioheads ok computer. well you can play it safe and narrow it down to halves nevermind defined alternative music for the first half of the 90s however for the second half ok computer came along and blew virtually every listeners minds possibly musicians too including r.e.ms michael stripe who calls radiohead impossibly good. this album would inspire many of todays artists who base their entire career off of the sound radiohead gave us on ok computer notably artists like coldplay where you can hear that radiohead inspired them. some crown it the greatest album of all time many claim it the album of the decade yet i am torn somewhere in between. ok computer right from the start is like an ecstatic pulse of joy to the eardrum. the songs are undoubtedly nothing short of genius masterworks. air bag is about being saved in an automobile accident by an airbag. whereas many of the other songs fall along similar subject lines technology being involved in our very lives. the sonic spacey guitars of airbag then shift to the modern day masterpiece paranoid android which you might be able to crown as the modern day bohemian rhapsody or happiness is a warm gun considering how it builds and shifts into a mini set of songs. paranoid android is undoubtedly my favorite track on the entire album. on the very day i purchased the album at this point i was thinking holy  this is amazing already. subterranean homesick alien sounds reminiscent of pink floyd if you chopped up dark side of the moon along with your household computer i am sure if it came out as a song this is exactly what it would sound like. exit music for a film was cut from the 1997 rendition of romeo and juliet soundtrack for no particular reason other than radiohead liked the song too much to give it up for a soundtrack and i really could not argue with them. the track is a slow heartbroken haunting acoustic track where thom yorke whispers over the microphone it is a beautiful experience. karma police is a true classic the piano is great it uses violins that notably do not sound like elanor rigby by the beatles which was another first it is undeniably great. things then move on to the bone chilling fitter happier which tells the sad story of what is expected from you of society how sad it sounds to leave a perfect life it adds a layer of loneliness to ones public life. electioneering has a jerky guitar rhythm and is the most fast paced track on the album. no suprises is another one of the better known tracks on the album and is beautiful sounding like the noise the toys that hang over a babys crib makes yet an ultimately dark subject matter i know of no other artists that pull this off so greatly. lucky is my second favorite song on the album it tells the story of a man who had just got in a plane crash and survived. the album ends and i realize that i may have very well just heard the greatest album of all time every single time the damn thing ends. i then want to listen to it over again.,1
because there are already so many excellent and thorough reviews of this album i will just give a brief account of the impact this music has had on me. having purchased the cd on a good friends recommendation in 2005 i was a relative latecomer to radiohead. after hearing it about three times in its entirety i realized that i was listening to a work of extraordinarily rare beauty and complexity. in fact it had been 30 years since i had experienced anything so stunningly powerful and well crafted and that was led zeppelins towering masterpiece physical graffiti released in 1975. my appreciation and understanding of ok as well as the intensity of enjoyment continues to grow and deepen with each successive spinnow numbering well into the thousands. this is an enduring masterwork that holds its own with the very finest music of any genre ever recorded. regardless of your particular taste in music give this album a chance and you will be forever glad you did.,1
best album of all time. no exceptions. i never knew music could be this good and i have been mostly disappointed with every new album i have heard since.,1
no matter where you look this album scores well and i think that is all the credit it needs - brilliant album - when it came out i thought what the f is that!! favourite songs - lucky airbag paranoid android - closely followed by all the others!!,1
it took me about 2 years to get into ok computer and when i finally did understand it i was so thrilled i instantly gave it five stars like over 4000 others have on this site. however upon relistening more recently although i do think it is a wonderful album i do not feel it is quite worthy of five stars. fitter happier has always been supremely annoying in my opinion and i have gradually got more sick of no surprises so that is the five stars out of the window straight away. on the other hand i can find little else to fault here. the songs are challenging and progressive but not so much so that they are unlistenable or boring. paranoid android is utterly brilliant as is karma police let down and all of the other songs that happen to be amongst my favourite radiohead tracks. compared to the previous album ok computer is not as consistently amazing but it works better as a whole album with an overwhelming miserable atmosphere that is far more enjoyable than you might think. whether the album really deserves all the acclaim is debatable but i cannot deny just how spectacular ok computer can be.,1
this edges on musical perfection as far as a rock album goes. although i prefer kid a and amnesiac ok computer is an album that i cannot really put below either. when over half the songs on the album are favorite songs in general it is hard not to love an album.,1
being the most rated and probably most reviewed album on the site i probably will not have much to add to the reviews here besides my own subjective experiences with ok computer which are fun to share for me but probably boring too read meh i will write something here anyway. i myself was born in 1987 so i sort of grew up with radiohead. strangely i was never familiar with creep although i must have heard it on the radio more than a couple of times. this lead that my first experience with radiohead was their 2 lead singles from this album paranoid android and karma police. i loved paranoid android but mostly because of the video for it and my opinion on karma police is kind of forgotten right now but i remember that i found them both beautiful but extreme depressive songs. and i loved the name radiohead  the album ok computer came into my life when i was about 14 years old. i lend it from my dad and at the time i was totally unaware of the praise it had gotten over the years or even that radiohead was one of the biggest bands of our time. i was just a small kid playing nirvana metallica and a little bit of alternative radio friendly music oh and slipknot and korn of course. the album did not strike me at all. in fact i found it vague depressing and really strange to say the least. the only songs i listened to in those times were again to 2 mentioned lead singles and perhaps airbag and exit music for a film. now a year of 2 later a friend told me about ok computer and that it was supposed to be the best album of all time according to some polls he saw. he himself loved it and said to me that i should give it a try again. i of course liked a couple of songs on the album already so i putted the disc in my stereo and started listening. i was stunned how beautiful it was and in no time the album was standing in my all time top albums then consisting of nothing more then my good old slipknot korn metallica and nirvana albums with of course metallicas ride the lightning leading it on the number 1. i later on discovered the rest of radioheads catalogue which besides the bends took some time as well to really click with me. kid a took like 2 years but it worked. the thing i have with radiohead is that every 4 -6 months i am craving for the band and i usually end up listening to mostly kid a and ok computer because of the extreme amount of emotion packed into these songs. the prime examples on this album are the 2 epics climbing up the walls and lucky which are 2 of my 3 favourite songs on here together with exit music for a film. those songs really get to me in a way almost no other piece of music can get to me. both songs are songs that i can put on non-stop and it are songs where the solos and climaxes are beyond words. in the first mentioned thom yorke even screams the final words which is again beyond words. after about 4 years of playing this album to death it still has not give in any of the power it had. in fact i now like it even better then say a year before it is like a fine wine that gets better with age but so fine it was already incredible when it was made.,1
somehow this has snuck up on me after listening to it about ten times at first it seemed outrageously overrated. still is but it is really good but the songs seem thrown together and there are some misses the fitter happier b.s.. subterranean homesick alien let down karma police and no surprises are the shining moments. 4 stars because there is really only two tracks i do not like the other one being exit music.,1
oh wow. this is an absolutely amazing album. undoubtedly the best in a long time and definitely one of the most revolutionary. with every listen i cannot help noticing another layer of brilliance in each song. some might say the bends is better that is just because this is really a very progressive album. the greatest. every song is amazing. i cannot even begin to describe to you the wonderful guitar that opens the album in airbag the beautiful complexity of paranoid android or the shivers up my spine whenever i hear exit music for a film and climbing up the walls which is in my opinion the best song on the album and one of the creepiest ever no pun intended. amazing.,1
great album. the musical arrangement of karma police sounds exactly like late-era beatles.,1
rating 7804. i am not even going to try to say anything new about this album. the second part of the album is not that great. i tend to lose interest during electioneering and climbing up the walls. absolute classic exit music for a film other great tracks paranoid android karma police fitter happier lucky also airbag subterranean homesick alien let down no surprises,1
brilliant album!!! i can even call it a legendary one. especially airbag paranoid android karma police and lucky. really worth hearing.,1
even though i had to listen to it for about a year before i comprehended what was going on ok computer is simply the best record to come out in the 90s. some say the best ever. it is up there. each spin i hear something completely different musically and lyrically. i still have not fully developed my own interpretation of the cd. i am probably a tool because of that. oh well.,1
the opening airbag and the very conceptual paranoid android together are worth 4 stars. paranoid android specifically is easily one of the most challenging tracks in latter musical years and proves it possible to blend punk and prog in a same number. also i think lucky holds lots of brief passing references to breathe and the narrow way pink floyd and to nothing at all gentle giant. the mournful background choir of exit music gets a bit wyatt-ish too. but then as with anything by pink floyd and as good as the melodies can get there is still that draggy feeling lurking just around the bend. ok computer along with rage against the machine s first and possibly nirvana is one of the very few interesting things to come out of the dormant 90s.,1
best song karma police it is hard for me to say much original about ok computer. i have heard before that what songs a person likes the most on this album say a lot about their musical tastes so i will mention my favorite songs from the album first. my 1 pick is karma police and i also really like paranoid android let down and no surprises. let down and no surprises are the catchiest songs on the album while karma police is a terrific beatles rip-off and i really love the coda. paranoid android is pretty scary as is climbing up the walls. there are some other interesting things on here too subterranean homesick alien was supposed to sound like miles davis but it came out more like an outtake from the dark side of the moon. the tourist also reminds me of pink floyd. plus airbag is the only song i know of about surviving a car wreck. radiohead have a knack for interesting arrangements on their songs like the glockenspiel on no surprises or the fuzz bass on exit music that i thought was a synthesizer until the internet told me otherwise. and i am not the first person to mention that thom yorke only sings the vowels in each word. the main problem with this album is the songwriting. besides paranoid android my other favorites were the most melodic songs. i liked a lot of this album but it could have been a 4.5 star album if the songwriting were stronger. p. s. why do not i hear radiohead more on the radio? they are called radiohead so they should be played more on the radio!,1
utterly brilliant. ethereal voice sometimes bombastic sometimes fragile arrangements and unpredictable the whole time. pure magic.,1
the most awesome album ever recorded. big call i know but sit down and think about that carefully. it is stilll consistant to this very day. solid moving scary and extremely well produced.,1
it is a fairly obvious statement to say this is one of the greatest albums of all times but as each year goes by from its release in 1997 its brilliance is amplified. quite simply nothing has come close since from any of our supposed great new bands that keep emerging. the brilliance is in the innovation the tragedy of the lyrics of a man who has quite simply given up on happiness and the unmistakable melody combined. i listened to this album the day my first serious relationship ended. my girlfriend was a pretentious one who was full of herself for very little good reason. the lyrics her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill have never resonated so well with my thoughts at the time. i smoked 20 marlboro lights listened to this album 3 times back to back. all of a sudden i knew what it really meant to feel fitter happier more productive.,1
what a fantastic album. probably my favourite 90s album. here is why airbag great opener. and nice lyrics quite sweet too. paranoid android no it is not the bo rhap of the 90s. fuck off. why comapre this great rocksong to the theatrical rockpop classic of the 70s. two great songs but so different. subterranean homesick alien a grower. never used to like this. but it has a great sound. exit music haunting. let down a favourite. the vocal parts harmonies as you will at the end are fantastic karma police a perfect single fitter happier more a filler electioneering more rocking. a good one but not that special. climbing up the walls see electioneering no surpises see karma police. lucky second best song on the album. quite emotional the tourist the bell at the end is one of the best endings of all album endings. as is this whole song.,1
no words to describe the beauty of this work. it is simply the sgt. peppers lonely heart club band of 90s.,1
oh. my. god. fucking fantastic my favourite song on the album is without a doubt exit music for a film but throughout it i find influences that helped carve olps greatest album and subsequently the greatest album ever spiritual machines. artistically ok computer is flawless. musically still flawless. one of the best albums ever made for sure.,1
this is not surprisingly my favorite radiohead album. it is pretty solid from beginning to end and karma police is simply amazing. if only the radiohead from 1997 and earlier would come back...,1
an outstanding landmark album. so many awesome moments lyrical and musical. and great depth. in isolation some of the lyrics appear meandering and pretentious. but the totality of the lyric works as imagery particularly when the music and lyrics play off each other in a swirling adventure - which is clearly the focus of the album. in many respects radiohead has elevated all of poprock as a genre for artistic expression within this album.,1
01 - airbag 10 02 - paranoid android 10 one of the greatest songs of all time 03 - subterranean homesick alien 9 04 - exit music for a film 10 05 - let down 10 06 - karma police 10 one of the greatest songs of all time 07 - fitter happier 2 08 - electioneering 9 09 - climbing up the walls 10 10 - no surprises 10 one of the greatest songs of all time 11 - lucky 10 12 - the tourist 9 overall radioheads best album the best album of the 90s and one of the greatest albums of all time. it is very rare that a band can be so varied and still be so brilliant. skip fitter happier and you will have nearly the perfect album.,1
i remember rushing out to buy ok computer on the day of it is release. i would gotten into radiohead a year or two earlier when i heard the bends another masterpiece. i would never really been into british music i was more drawn to what was going on over the water the us provided me with nirvana pearl jam stone temple pilots the afghan whigs screaming trees etc - which appealed to me more. but radiohead really blew me away. they did not just create an atmosphere through sonic landscapes there was songs and they were outstanding songs. the one-two intro of airbag and paranoid android was daunting and still is. subterranean homesick alien exit music and let down were all in someway joyous. climbing up the walls was unsettling but extraordinary. not to mention karma police no surprises and tourist. i still think ok computer is a stunning even haunting record which still stands tall after all this time. ok computer gave british music the shot in the arm in badly needed. it pushed the boundaries of what musicians could do - why should an ambitious idea remain an ambitious idea? make an ambitious record paranoid android. daring ambitious and although it is not instantly accessible it is rewarding. the computer age indeed. without a doubt a classic album. a career peak.,1
greatest album of all time by far. thom yorke is my idol.every song is brilliant.paranoid android is my favorite song.,1
the only radiohead album that i own but its still pretty good. not the perfect album its hyped up to be though.,1
this was there first really experimental album and from this album on they only got better and better!,1
i do not know how to review the album that means more to me than anything else ever recorded. especially an album that has been commented on and disected about a billion times before by a billion other people. i am not even sure it is as good as the way i feel about it - but does that really matter? it is not pretentious or boring as naysayers might try and argue. it is a collection of observations basically but not souless intellectual observations that judge. rather radiohead acknowledge and infuse a kind of understanding and empathy into stories about people they might not and we may not even understand. it is also about the way we cope with the world - by creating a false sense of security airbag to hiding behind materialism until it turns us into monsters paranoid android to dreams of escape exit music subterranean homesick alien feelings of hopelessness and hopefulness mixed together let down rage climbing up the walls and giving up no surprises. strip away all the analysis though and you just find some great songs. the end of let down is practically transcendent and the it is going to be a glorious day in lucky never ever gets old. a perfect album that opened up so many other albums to me.,1
good album albeit overrated. some songs are fantastic though like climbing up the walls exit music and the tourist. not the best album of any era but definitely worth a listen by anyone who enjoys music.,1
i am not going to say this is the best album ever and i will probably get shot for it but i do not think it is. i like no surprises and karma police and a couple of other individual tracks. but the album as a whole seems to vague experimental and up-its-own-arse for me. admittedly it may have more secrets to divulge to me on future spins so i will stay open-minded. ok now i have lsitened to this more i absolutely love it. the gently strummed acoustic guitars in the background throughout the unwavering sense of bleakness and melancholia it is just genius - all of the little bits of random noise contribute the track order is so perfectly crafted. above all i love the sense of solitarity and alienation that of being all alone in a world where everyone else seems to be devoting their time to something you do not understand. i would say subterranean homesick alien is one of the best due to the capture of this emotion and no surprises also for the ambience of resignation and acceptance. let down too. but the album as a whole is far grewater than the sum of its parts.,1
like any good musical art ... this is worth listening too just for the experience ...,1
there are very few albums that have affected me as much as ok computer. from the first track airbag with its sweeping guitar and hypnotic drum beat the music is brilliant rich atmospheric and enthralling. every note sound effect and lyric adds to the whole of this album to create a masterpiece. paranoid android is an instant classic a three part epic of isolation and madness. there is nothing that is on this album that should not be even fitter happier with its electronic voice and eerie piano makes for an excellent mood-establishing track to begin the albums second half. climbing up the walls is a chilling look into the mind of a killer bringing about the highest point of climax on the album though there are many. essentially every song is a highlight though my personal favorites are let down and exit music for a film. from start to finish i cannot get enough of this album. the point buy it. nothing comes even close.,1
not all music has to be uptight. but this record is depressing if you do not let it influence you real bad. it also contains one of the best emotional mixes of new wave rock electronics and beatlespink floyd like melodies  experimentation. it sounds like a constructed painting. it deserves to be called albums of the nineties and one of the best records of all time.,1
fucking amazing cd. thom yorke is a genious and johnny greenwood is one of the most original guitarists out there.,1
grand classique toujours considr comme un des meilleurs disques de tous les temps ok computer des britanniques de radiohead est un grand album. il a ni plus ni moins rvolutionn  la fin des annes 90 la pop music apportant une multitude dides et de trouvailles que ce soit dun point de vue sonore ou en terme dambiance. car oui ok computer cest du travail dorfvre ! pour sen convaincre rien de tel quune coute approfondie du chef duvre de cet album paranoid android son ambiance ces sonorits intemporelles et cette voix  tomber ce nest pas fini exit music for a film laisse pantois dadmiration tant thom yorke arracherait mme une larme aux plus gros mtalleux insensibles. les autres titres ne sont pas en reste que ce soit lassez exprimental airbag un excellent subterranean homesick alien les plus couls let down et karma police le  presque  joyeux et entranant electioneering le mystique climbing up the walls ou les non moins russis no surprises lucky ou the tourist. incontestablement ok computer fait partie des albums marquants jamais un groupe navait sonn comme radiohead et jamais plus quiconque ne sonnera comme le radiohead dok computer. on peut sans doute rester insensible  cette froideur caractristique pour ma part je reste impressionn par tant de talent et de matrise !,1
it is flawless but just does not do anything for me. it does not have the it factor.,1
this is not a completely perfect album but most of the songs are wonderful. it certainly deserves its place as one of the best albums of all time. favorites paranoid android exit music for a film karma police electioneering,1
to say that ok computer is the best album of the 90s and in some more extreme cases the best album ever have the tendency to work on my nerves. but one thing i do agree with is that ok computer is an exceptional release. paranoid android remains a musical tour de force to this very day and the simplistic but melodic landscape of songs like karma police and exit music still inspires. the album has one weak point and that is the album closer the tourist - it really ends of an other wise flawless album on an extremely dull note. i still give ok computer 5 stars since the rest of the album is deserved of this recognition. also a sentimental favorite,1
i will never forget listening to this album with some friends shortly after it came out. it was a saturday afternoon. we were in my college dorm room. the mushrooms were glorious. but the music was so much better.,1
deserves all the accolades showered upon it. this album along with kid a summarizes the paranoia and uncertainty surrounding the past decade if not the entire information revolution.,1
this album is quite simply perfect. it may be depressing but you cannot say it is bad. if you do not like this then you do not like music. end of discussion.,1
this is a 90s classic. a true metamorphosis of the band tom york leads radiohead truly through experimentation. and it is with this album that they do the most convincing balance between rock music electronic and experimentation. this album marks the beginning of a new era of alternative rock and inspired a whole group of bands like early muse coldplay doves just mentioning the main. in the top of progressive songs of this album there is paranoid android. without a doubt it is a progressive track there is no way to avoid it! it is constituted by three different parts the first sadness with a well orchestrated versuschorus pattern the second the explosion in which the guitar the bass and the drums are very well performed and the last the depression with a very moving melancholic cascade of voices. following we have the atmospheric subterranean homesick alien and the catchy let down. exit music for a film is again a 2 part track with the last being an explosion part like in paranoid android but mainly achieved by emotional vocals. the two rockers of the album beyond the supreme paranoid android itself it is the first track airbag which presents a very catchy guitar riff and a great bass work and the almost punky electioneering which could be a song taken from their previous albums. the album ends with the trio no surprises lucky and the tourist with the melancholic mode and the imaginative soundscaping that characterizes radiohead. karma police is an unforgettable ballad very dramatic extremely beautiful great sonority and without having the prototype of the traditional architecture of a track it is subdivided again in 2 parts. a very original crafted lushed album. a masterpiece of feeling beauty and melancholy. it changed music.,1
quite simply the most beautiful music ever created in rock and roll history. it takes you through a range of emotions and i come back to it again and again.,1
quite possibly the greatest album of all time. personally i prefer their album the bends but there really is not much to choose between the two. superb.,1
this is closely behind radioheads kid aamnesiac releases my second favourite album ever. i will not try to describe what makes radiohead so great to listen to numerous music critics have tried and failed. just take my word for it and buy this album. then buy kid a,1
fitter happier annoys me so much that i cannot give it 5 stars but i would give it 4.99 if possible. the most influential album of 1990s do not even talk about nirvana - where is grunge now?. favorite track karma police,1
up until the last couple months i have only heard ok computer in airportstrain stations for the last 5 years in an age when everyone has an opinion on ok computer it is the only way to keep it safe and sacred to me. since it is gone from being one of the best albums of the 90s to one of the best albums ever over the last couple of years the counter-culture crowd have not been kind to radiohead and their magnum opus. i cannot imagine how awful it would be to hear this album at the wrong moment in the wrong environment and hear it as rolling stones 162 album of all time or even worse over hyped garbage. i feel ok computer has done so much for me on a emotional and imaginative level that at the very least i can do is protect it from the outside worlds opinions that i was oblivious to as a kid. i never fully got the concept of a band by the time i was 10. even though my brother had one and i had a favorite band i think superdrag i still did not get the concept entirely. radiohead only furthered this weird state of mind as i spotted posters and icons that connected to the band. i went to a friend of a friends house who had a ok computer poster on his wall i cannot explain the feeling it gave me to see it. it was like he had the mark of cain and we all belonged to some club that was meant for something more in the world. vhs tapes that say radiohead on it weird t-shirts my brother would wear with hand breaking glass that said radiohead and this ugly cover with a babys face i was given as a present that said radiohead on it. perhaps in the same way growing up with the beatles might have done finding ok computer at such an early age gave me such a unexplainable excitement on what art can do and be it felt more like a movement to save the world at the end of the century and we all were going to be apart of it. aside from becoming a cure for insomnia in 97 it became the soundtrack to going in and out of airports and train stations. such an exciting wonderful place where cold industrial design makes the light come in like a ray of heaven. all the strange noises and announcements sounding far from human but resembled us well enough. the people going in and out of my life at an overwhelming rate. it was a place that made everything seem possible and probable watching it all go by to the soundtrack of ok computer just clicked with me on such a deep level and still does. to see so many people in such a detached state in one of the most curious places you can be could you imagine what people from past generations would think of these establishments? was as wonderful as it seems scary now. i cannot talk about how selway implemented dj shadow breaks and loops in the drums or how greenwoods use of guitar effects are beyond anything else ever as the album will never speak to me that way and i never would want it to. what i can talk about is how odd my connection to the album is nearly 10 years later. it is made me recall many things i have forgotten that i guess i kept to myself in the airportstrain stations. like how i was 100 convinced i was an alien until i was 12 and was ready to be brought home any moment or how i saw the boogyman standing next to my bed watching me sleep within my dreams various times. i guess now it would be about alienation and the boogyman is the government putting cameras everywhere but there is something still very tangible and haunting in those earlier beliefs. ok computer will always be a huge chunk of escapism in my life i would not be surprised if i have a mid-life crisis one day and sleep at an airport terminal for a night playing ok computer. much like laughing stock and in the aeroplane over the sea ok computer takes me so deep into a world i can never compare to the one i currently occupy i guess the thing that makes it better is that it feels like i am returning to something at the same time. contains lyrics album artpackaging a rent or buy buy,1
one of the most accessible and catchy albums of all-time. i am a huge catchy-song fan and it took me two listens to fall in love with ok computer. just make sure the second listen takes place at night when you are cold and alone and a little bit lonely. when there are strangers around me i strongly feel like singing these songs. this is what you get this is what you get rain down rain down from a great height from a great height height i lost myslf i lost myself. one of the best things is lyrics often come in pairs so the people around me are guaranteed to hear them. it feels so good to force these songs into their ears. one of the most beautiful creations music has seen. quote from another review also this might sound weird but there is a video game that i suggest every ok computer fan play. it is system shock 2 on pc. reasons 1. the game is also dark and scary. 2. the game has a similar themetopic to ok computer. 3. ok computer is no. 9 album of all-time. system shock 2 is no. 15 pc game of all-timeaccording to gamerankings.com. both are extremely well-made products with very deep contents. 4. ok computer released in 1997. system shock 2 in 1999. 5. computer and system a good match. 6. ok and shock subtle connections exist. 7. i experienced them in the same december. it almost feels like they are the same eternity just in different formsrock music and computer game. just do not play the game while listening to the album. the game has techno soundtracks of its own.,1
i can not say anything about this album that someone else has not mentioned prior. easily one of the best albums of the 90s not my personal choice but i would not argue that this is not the best from the 90s either.,1
a perfect modern soundtrack to a dystopia. some of the most haunting yet beautiful rock music ever penned.,1
how did they manage to get it so damn right in the middle of that impossible decade? and 10 years later it is still right - untainted by zillions of opinions and attempts at jarring that essence. it must have been divine intervention because they never came this close to bliss anymore. no wait i am an atheist it must be survival of the fittest tune then.,1
folk may criticise this because it is so popular and so highly acclaimed but the fact remains that this is a stunning album consistently brilliant just listen to the triplet of electioneering climbing up the walls and no surprises and you cannot deny the power and emotion,1
this is truely a masterpiece and my favorite album from the 90s. almost every song is excellent so please listen to this you probably will not regret it. the song i like the most no surprises.,1
if its 2007 and you are looking at reviews for ok computer and you have not heard it its very important that you do. it will change the way you look at popular music.,1
this might be the only album that it took me awhile to get into that was actually worth the effort. at first the only songs i really liked were let down karma police and no surprises. in particular climbing up the walls just sounded like noise but it revealed itself to have an amazing melody. after several listens nearly all the songs were masterpieces. airbag leads things off with a somewhat trip-hop sound. although i am not that much a fan of the first and third sections of paranoid android it has one of my favorite guitar solos of all time and no matter what the band says i maintain that it is about the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. lucky contains thoms greatest vocal performance of the album. the tourist is a bit dull but serves as a perfect ending to the album and contains some fabulous guitar from i assume johnny.,1
maybe there is no hope for society after all. maybe the human race is fated to self-destruct in a blaze of glory without ever having understood its purpose or meaning in this strange existence. it hardly matters though because the beauty of life itself has a way of transcending its torments and ok computer teaches us how unmistakably true this is. in a world of escalating superficiality and materialism radiohead were able to depict so intricately and beautifully the collective psyche of our current reality and the pitfalls of the direction we are headed in. the most special thing about ok computer is radioheads ability to channel the feelings of society and express it in such a real and affecting way. this album is not about thom yorke or the bands other members it is about our collective dynamic with the world we live in. it is a kind of musical mirror of the thread of feelings that runs through us all even if we are not conscious of them. what makes ok computer more formidable is the vibrant and mesmerizing energy created by its power and spirit of truth. it is an energy i want to get lost in because the realness and and specialness of it will never be matched by the world as we know it. it gives me enough distance to help me achieve a clearer perspective on life and what i want out of it which is the overall spiritual effect ok computer has had on me. that is the mystery and the beauty of it the mystery being how ok computer let us you understand life more clearly while letting you escape from it and the beauty being that when you see reality as it is it loses its ability to harm you metaphysically. everything everyone everywhere needs to listen to this.,1
ok ok computer...! okc es por si no lo saban uno de los mejores discos de los 90 junto con clsicos como nevermind nima o alguno de massive attack. el disco en si no es tan solido como se puede presuponer pero sus canciones tienen tanto peso son tan hermosas que es dificil no amar cosas como karma police paranoid android no surprises y mi favorita let down. un lbum de grandes bellas canciones sumado a la experimentacin tpica de radiohead hacen de este uno de los mejores discos que escuch. hay algunas cosas que sobran lucky airbag fitter hapier the tourist pero las dems son canciones muy pero muy buenas. paranoid android es una cancin en tres partes que combina melancola con ritmos hasta bailables. exit music es un temazo totalmente hipntico y depresivo una gran cancin. let down es una cancin muy importante en mi vida cuantas veces abr llorado de solo escucharla.... karma police es un himno. electioneering es lo ms arriba del disco. climbing up the walls da miedito no surprises es de lo ms bello de radiohead. en fin una gran gran disco.,1
this is an amazing album. there is not a single bad track here and even if there was i would not care because it works well as one big unit. tracks like airbag and exit music for a film are epics and no surprises is heartbreakingly beautiful. this is the only album i own besides the soft bulletin by the flaming lips and maybe yoshimi that can get me emotional. plus climbing up the walls is genuinely scary. that is cool.,1
after owning the album for almost five years hearing it in buts and pieces for jsut as long hearing it in its entirety a couple times tonight is the first time i have ever listened to it fully i get it now. i never understood the praise piled upon it but now it is all too clear. a perfectly composed and solemn symphony of brooding sound. one of the albums we would have to put in a time capsule for being a great example of its time and era.,1
i 19971998 i witnessed the wonderful video for ok computer. really seriously this was one of the most innovative albums since blurs earlier work among other artists i had heard in the 90s. not because of the complicated instrumentation chords and vocals... no it was no beck no re-invention it was something so new. this album is not something to jump around to - this is an album to frame on a wall forever repeating.,1
this is not dark side of the moon of the nineties. truly an outstanding album but for me it seems to be a bit just a bit overrated. i am not really keen on yorkes vocalizing his voice makes it pure psychedelic sounding it is a fact. paranoid android exit music for a film karma police love the video very much just like of paranoid android climbing up the walls no surprises and the tourist are definitely brilliant tracks both musically both in production the rest is weaker in places. i am very much fond of progressive music also those of the modern sounding but this records after several years of owning listening could not really grow on me that is why i did not dare to try their later more experimental albums so far. probably that day will come once.,1
great album. most of these songs are excellent. it is not in the top 10 albums of all time or anything but definitely the top 100. the piano in karma police sounds exactly like sexy sadie on the beatles white album...,1
just listening to this for the first time in ages... why oh why had i marked it down as only 45? fixed. probably the best produced album i have ever heard...,1
the greatest album of all time- every track is absouloutly perfect. the only word to describe this is perfect.thom yorke is a genius.best tracks are no surprisesparanoid android and exit music but every track is just as good as these really.,1
dark side of the moon for my generation,1
one of the few radiohead albums that actually gets the credit it deserves ok computer is one of the greatest albums i have ever layed ears on.,1
un disco repleto de calidad buen gusto ruidos que son parte de nosotros sensibilidad... 5 sobre 5.,1
they have almost overproduced the life out of this album but it is still a monumental work. what other band could include such a diverse range of tracks from the multi-section progressive paranoid android through the computer-voiced fitter happier to the gentle ballad no surprises and have it all work and fell like a coherent piece of work. if you like this and you do not know much of the rest of their work i recommend skipping to hail to the thief rather than the less accessible kid a and amnesiac and then going back to them. it is more of a progression than the time-based sequence.,1
all of the hype is true. this is really one of the most amazing albums ever made. not being much of an alternative fan at the time i was skeptical about an album made in 1997 getting all of the praise it got. i got it and listened to it and pretty much like airbag and paranoid android and forgot about it for awhile. i picked it up again months later and i am glad i did. every song is fantastic. whether it is rocking emotional atmospheric chilling or epic you are going to be feeling something special during each and every one of these songs save obviously fitter happier airbag is at truly unique sounding song that must be heard. paranoid android defines epic and has a riff at one point that rivals the riff used at the climax of bohemian rhapsody aka massive head bang subterranean homesick alien is worthy of floyd. exit music is chilling and dark. let down is wonderfully dreamy. karma police i cannot really describe the emotion it is like epic in a short amount of time. when it gets to the end its just incredible. electioneering is a bit too rocking for this album but its still fun to listen to. climbing up the walls is dark and creepy and took me awhile to get into but still great track to listen to. no surprises reminds me of the dreamy style of let down except dreamier. lucky is a bleak song until the chorus which is so lush it gives you chills. the tourist is an epic closer with some fantastic vocals. one of the few overhyped albums out there deserves every bit of praise its given. i wish more modern bands could take a cue from radiohead. this album gives me hope for the future of music. i am seriously proud to be a fan of this album and hope that this album can reach others and touch them as it did me,1
toma ya este disco cambi mi vida bueno era la cassette pero luego me pill el cd 2 veces creo que no puedo decir nada de ok computer solamente que si no lo has escuchado eres extraterrestre ah no esos tambin lo han escuchado,1
this album saved my life!!!!!! while contemplating suicide in early 2001. i felt as if the world was against me that technology in general would get the best of humanity. then my friend gave me this album. i realized that i was not alone in my way of thinking. that it was okay because in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe. this album is a great story from beginning to end. it will take atleast 15 listens to get but be patient! you will get there. i suggest smokin a spliff or have a few glasses of wine. just to relax to be able to focus. then finally you will be able to swallow that you are right. technology will take us over but we can still be happy til then...,1
a masterpiece a classic up there with the best of the 60s and 70s rock. the greatest artistic achievement of the 90s and second most important record of the decade after nirvanas nevermind - which arguably lead the way into mainstream to the entire alt-rock scene radiohead included. as every well crafted concept album the whole album is greater than the simple sum of each song. plus this one is practically flawless not every song is great in itself but each one concurs to the perfect flowing of sound from the starting crunching guitar to the final tinkle of a triangle. the tracklist airbag 4.5 - awesome drum and bass lines a great start which makes the listener aware that something has changed from the bends... paranoid android 5 - simply astonishing. a work of art period. subterranean homesick alien 4 - dylanian title and typical rh-ish atmosphere. mellow and dreamy. great arrangement and awesome lyrics. exit music for a film 4.5 - starts with a minimal acoustic riff and bursts into a wonderful crescendo. let down 3.5 - excellent melodic track but it lacks something to call it great. karma police 5 - another classic personally i prefer a few other rh songs than this one but you simply cannot rate it other than 5. fitter happier na - not being a real song it is difficult to rate. anyway it is not a filler it perfectly fits its slot and the lyrics are pure ace. electioneering 4 - the rock track! outstanding guitar riff - and final three-guitar jam climbing up the walls 4 - noisy spooky and beautiful another little work of art no surprises 5 - absolutely perfect my favourite track lucky 4.5 - a classic style ballad. excellent solo by jonny greenwood the tourist 3.5 - written by jonny greenwood it is good but i find it a little monotonous thus the not-so-brilliant rating,1
their best record and coming from an outstanding band a masterpiece. for me it is hard to decide between ok and kid a because they are quite different but both are perfect. ok computer combines rock with some electronic touches and the fusion is amazing. the lyrics awesome too for example listening to exit music for a film makes me feel like i am on this song. an odd but beautiful feeling. the best song is paranoid android and i think it is the best radiohead song although i like more others. airbag is one of the best opening tracks ever.,1
beautiful mind-bending stuff here from radiohead. it is well known as their best ever record and although i can see why that decision is made by many i personally prefer kid a. this is a record that will favourite record or not continue to return to your cd-player time after time.,1
radioheads 1997 release ok computer has been their most critically acclaimed and well-received album to date. it brings the band into a whole new world of music abandoning for the most part their earlier hardpop-rock persona for an easier electronic-progressive like tone. it has been decided many times to be the greatest album of all time by various critics and music magazines. this is the most-own radiohead album and is a great purchase for a music fan of any genre. most recommended songs 1. paranoid android 2. karma police 3. no surprises 4. exit music for a film 5. electioneering,1
what can i say about this album that has not been said before? without hyperbole it is one of the legitimate top ten albums of the 20th century. it is one of the few albums that has been loved by both the public and the critics and is rightly portrayed as the most influential hour of music the 90s gave us. every song is a gem - even the weakest track climbing up the walls is essential. the first six songs take you to that state of mental bliss that only music has the ability to do. starting with airbag soaring through paranoid android and ending with karma police - i doubt there has been a stronger first half of an album on any record. the second half is not as good as the first half but it is still fantastic. fitter happier is a disturbing interlude and electioneering is just brutal. no surprises has one of the creepiest riffs i have ever heard while lucky sounds like the soundtrack to a wide-screen production of the apocalypse. that might sound cheesy but when you hear it you will know what i mean. the album finishes with the tourist and ends with a single tap of a xylophone. never before has one note sounded so mighty. in short everything you need to know about this album has been said many many times. just believe the hype - it is all true.,1
this album lives up to every superlative anyone has ever thrown at it. rock it.,1
no question about it this is a very good album. but i cannot for the life of me figure out why it is considered the best of the 90s ndash or even the best of 1997. either this album is not nearly as good as people think it is or i am missing something big. it is probably the latter.,1
no album can be to everyone tastes but it takes a special album to be loved by a large majority of the public. ok computer is one of those special albums it is one of the most critically praised albums of all time while there are still some people who see the album as over-rated. radiohead have created an album that is amazingly beautiful and dreary. most people will find a lot to love about ok computer whether it be the epic paranoid android the scary climbing up the walls the beautiful no surprises or any of the other magnificent tracks. ok computer is enjoyed by many people all over the world and deserves every accolade it receives.,1
a masterpiece i could never get tired of it. paranoid android which contains a similitude with the pretty thingss in the square - 1970 exit music climbing up the walls airbag karma police no surprises...great !,1
funny...sometimes i think it is overrated.....but i always come back to it....great album....takes repeated listens to like....but once you like it you can see what the hype was all about. every song is an experience and it was unlike anything that came out that year.,1
well here is trouble. fact is i admire radiohead yet i do not really like radiohead. i can appreciate all the great reviews yet somehow as a whole they leave me cold i find myself on the outside wondering what all the fuss is about. as for the band so for this album. there are several tracks i think are wonderful -- no surprises karma police exit music for a film -- but in the end it is like trying to worship in a gothic cathedral you admire the achitecture yet cannot help noting that it is too damn cold for comfort. is ok computer a good album? yep. a great album? sure. one of the greatest? well ...,1
this was my first radiohead album and their earliest 90s rock stuff had a big effect on me when i was 13 or 14. i remember i bought this album asked my dad to put it on in the car and then took it into the house and did not stop playing it for weeks on end. then when kid a clicked it lost its shine and i end up here today enjoying only a handful of songs on it and letting it go. a historic album sure but one that did not particularly age well. i never play this any more and i do not particularly miss it.,1
truly a masterpiece. ok computer is the only album i could honestly say is the most perfect album out there. from thom yorkes vocals to the instrumentals. greatest album of the 90s if not ever.,1
this album is oozing so much quality it is hard to believe that it all exists on one cd. ok computer proves that radiohead are a great band.,1
consider the lot you must have heard about this album already. sure it is often surrounded by an unbelievably high wall of pretenses. what we are all saying when we unanimously endorse the greatness of this album is this let this album happen to you. seriously.,1
mimo e za spraw wydanego dwa lata wczeniej the bends radiohead byli gwiazdami to dopiero rok 1997 okaza si przeomowy dla tej formacji. najpierw by fenomenalny koncert na festiwalu w glastonbury ktry uznano za najlepszy koncert wszechczasw a potem premiera ok computer. muzycy radiohead postanowili rozwin motywy zapocztkowane w planet telex i street spirit i dopracowa brzmienie dodajc rne futurystyczne odgosy. efekt jest piorunujcy co docenili tez krytycy album dostawa prawie wszdzie maksymalne oceny i suchacze komercyjnie przebi nawet the bends. co zaskakujce bo nie mam na nim potencjalnych przebojw. jest za to wszystko inne od rozbudowanej suity paranoid android po fantastyczn ballad exit music. kady z utworw sta si antykomercyjnym hymnem. byli wtedy niedocignieni zostawiali konkurencje daleko w tyle a jednak nagrody dla pyty roku zgarniao the verve za urban hymnes . czas jednak dziaa na korzy ok computer i po latach pyty sucha si jeszcze lepiej i dzi trudno wyobrazi sobie inn pyt na szczycie rankingu na najlepsze pyty lat dziewidziesitych. oczywicie cakowicie zasyouenie.,1
i do not think there is a soul alive that has not heard this album classical fans heavy metalists many genres of music all say this is one hell of an album this has been voted best album ever many times by many reviewers magazines and chart shows i can see this point of view but i honestly just think that kid a and amnesiac combined are better,1
arguably the most important and influential album of the past 20 years. ok computer is filled with part ambient experimental part rock and indie tracks to make it a finely crafted masterpiece. the standout song is paranoid android which is a 6 12 minute track filled with musical genius. every other track is also very powerful lyrically and musically most notably karma police and let down.,1
the third verse of let down is simply the greatest ever moment in music. other orgasmic moments -it is going to be a glloooooooorrriouuss daayyy! -such a pretty house and such a pretty garden -exit music from 248 onward ........ i could go on all day,1
one of the best albums ever i love it like mad. you can listen to it and feel something no matter what mood your in. best tracks airbag paranoid android let down no suprises the tourist,1
bam bam bam bam. chink un dee doo deee doo dee dooo. inda nezzt vert ver i am about to undevers zegrat zetranova mein unbug zig mig licht. aug wuh nivch. jau!,1
the most overrated album of all-time is surprisingly still a great album. plenty to enjoy on here including climbing up the walls one of my favorite radiohead songs. the bends is definitely better a better album from front to back though. seriously though... 9 all-time? this is supposedly better than who is next and velvet underground and nico?! no chance in hell.,1
a four-star album like any other a lot of good stuff and some not-that-good stuff.,1
sad songs played beautifully with soaring epic instrumentation. lucky and subterranean build up in an indescribably emotional way that splits me wide open every time i hear them and i will never tire of the way those songs make me feel.,1
when i first heard this album i just thought that it was overrated nerd music. it still is but this appeals to the lonely nerd within everyone.,1
after all these yearsi have come to realise ok computer may be my least favorite radiohead album. why? perhaps because i know it inside out. perhaps also because it has simply worn out on me. ok computer is radioheads third and most successful album to date. it has been praised as one of the top 10 indie albums of all time by many music critics. it contains the hits paranoid android karma police and no surprises. an album that came at the right time between the development of prog rock the end of alternative rock and the birth of the e-world it marks the perfect moment where human kind was being confonted to fear and alienation. now when i listen to it it really sounds like an indie album and nothing much more. i guess this means that radiohead has really developed and matured and that they are no oasis or blur. musically this album contains some of radioheads most well known songs airbag paranoid android exit musicfrom romeo and juliet karma police and no surprises. the best track on here would have to be lucky which set the tone nicely for what was to come and there is also fitter happier is an absolute stroke of genious something which was going to be further developed in kid a. despite this this is no doubt radioheads best perhaps on par with kid a. each song is an absolute classic minus the minor dissapointments let down and the non ear pleasing electioneering and we all know this . i am just saying what i feel about the album after all these years.,1
although i think this is like the most overrated album ever i can see why. let down is my favorite song they all are pretty good.,1
consumerism globalisation postmodernism social alienation depression paranoia... the themes of the album although never being a part of a concept have stood the test of time and are as relevant as they were back in 1997. by keeping its relevance ok computer has become one of the most important albums of our time. although influenced by several musicians of different styles like miles davis krzysztof penderecki the beatles and dj shadow ok computer cannot be compared to any other album. it is unique and innovative to an extent yet not completely revolutionary. it is atmospheric and beautiful in it is own way yet not everyone is cup of tea. despite all its paradoxes ok computer could quickly acclaim the classic status by music critics and mutual admiration amongst fans. from the very beginning of airbag the adventurous mood is set and it guides us through the whole album without being absent even for a second. it is only the listener and the music and nothing in between. even the six and a half-minute long the modern guitar rock classic paranoid android sounds too short. as the album progresses and arrives to probably the best combo on the whole album hopeless exit music for a film and completely alienated and instrument preferred let down. the two songs have almost nothing alike yet they flow together in the best possible way. the first half of the album ends with piano-based beatlesque sexy sadie-like karma police which is probably the most accessible and radio-friendly composition here. from fitter happier to climbing up the walls ok computer is at it is darkest and most disturbing before arriving to it is climax as yorkes effortless voice in the xylophone-driven and poignantly beautiful no suprises almost whispers a heart that is full up like a landfilla job that slowly kills you i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxidewith no alarms and no surprises. as jonny greenwoods guitars almost crying on lucky and the tourist the album gets it to closing act leaving no regrets in the listener who is begging for an encore. musically of course it is always been an important and an enormously influential modern rock album as the huge number of radiohead-copycats has shown us... still ok computer is in the league of it is own never having to confront a follower that could have matched the standard set by thom yorke and co. it is not even radioheads best album but no other release by them sounds as refreshing and uplifting after neglecting it for some period of time. ok computer still remains one of the best albums ever recorded.,1
i think it is very difficult to refute that radiohead are the best band to come out of the 90s. the lyrics are awesome the instruments are masterfully played thom yorke scares the shit out of me when he sings. this album is their highest point. the songs are very diverse from a sense of rebirth to bitterness to paranoia. best tracks airbag electioneering no surprises.,1
um disco verdadeiramente brilhante um dos melhores lbuns da histria. o disco veio no momento certo com canes dosadas da forma certa dificilmente a banda chegar ao nvel que alcanou com esta obra-prima. nenhuma faixa  irrelevante talvez tourist e fitter happier mas o disco como toda possui tantas prolas que seria redundante enumerar quase toda a listagem das faixas. paranoid android  o prototipo de faixa quase perfeita complexa e criativa sem pender para a chatice. arranjos criativos empolgantes comoventes formam a moldura dessa delcia sonora. como bem disse o crtico zeca camargo na resenha desse disco o disco  to excitante que a resenha deveria ter sado na playboy e no na bizz hehehe,1
this one starts with one of the greatest opening tracks ever they find the right combination between alternative pop  rock. then paranoid android starts when you think of paranoid android with great drums and lyrcis like when i am king you the first against the wall. subterranean homesick alien to me the best song of the album i know hardly everyone would disagree but it is my opinion. then a song written for romeo  julia comes up called exit music for a film so fucking great the lyrics make laugh everytime i hear it. then the best ong lyrical shows up called let down. karma police is the pop songs of the album what creep  high  dry where for the earlier albums. filter happier is a stupid skit. enough a bout that next songs electioneering it is too hard for me but i can understand much people like it. climbing up the walls it is different from other songs of the album but i would say electioneering is a good intro to this song. the rhythm and the lyrics of the main part usually remain in your mind for a while if you listen to this song for a few times. no surprises is not very specil. the album ends with one of the best songs on the album  lucky. 5 stars for ok computer,1
i came to be a radiohead fan a quite late. i would seen them live back in 93 or 94 when they were touring in support of pablo honey and i did not think much of them. to me they sounded like english grunge posers who would gotten lucky with a pretty cool song with creep. in comparison to pearl jam who i also saw live around that time they were just pretenders. that was the end of that for me for quite some time. in 2001 after reading a few gushing reviews that i frankly thought must have been some kind of a joke i bought a copy of ok computer to hear this so called masterpiece for myself. imagine my surprise then when i heard the beginning of the opening track airbag with it is distorted guitar cellos and tripped out drums. of course it did not stop there. every track was a revelation. every track was beautiful in some new and mystifying way. of course i immediately realized the error of my ways and have ever since regretted dismissing radiohead so out of hand. oh woe is me.,1
absolutely amazing transports you to another world not so different from our own and you can feel the cold superficial emptiness of modern life perfectly immortalised in this record. this is one of the greatest albums ever made and is truly the revolver of the 90s,1
i am kicking myself for not listening to radiohead sooner. i heard people say they were over-rated so i did not bother. those people are wrong. this album deserves all the praise it gets and if you have not had a listen i would suggest you do. this album is loaded with great songs and absolutely no filler minus fitter happier maybe. 1. airbag 1010 2. paranoid android 1010 3. subterranean homesick alien 910 4. exit music for a film 910 5. let down 1010 6. karma police 1010 7. fitter happier 610 8. electioneering 710 9. climbimg up the walls 1010 10. no suprises 1010 11. lucky 910 12. the tourist 1010,1
my second favorite radiohead album. i love listening to this album and knowing where the band was going musically. this album is a cornerstone for there career and made them to what they are today.,1
so i have been given an assignment to review two albums in my collection that i have rated similarly and eventually pick which is my favorite. the records chosen for me are radiohead ok computer and wire 154. both of which at the time i had rated 3 stars. my first impression of the records and this assignment before going back to listen to them was that these two records mark the turning points of both these bands. which was partly the reasoning behind the choice of these albums. but on a more personal level this is also the point in which i quit listening to both of these bands. which probably has a lot to do with my original 3 star rating of each of these albums. i know people who will sing the praises of both of these bands after these points but i could never get into their later stuff. upon listening to these records again i could not help but realize i was wrong on my original ratings. i cannot help but wonder if that was not part of why these records were chosen for me. i cannot remember ever enjoying 154 as much. one thing that i noticed about both of these records is that this is where both of these bands started to use electronics. wire goes for a much darker sound while radiohead uses it more in the background to highlight the songs. all in all if i have to chose one over the other it would have to be this radiohead album largely because i believe that this is the high point of their career while wire was never quite able to live up to pink flag though chairs missing was close. in fact i probably overlooked 154 all these years because i wanted another pink flag when the only way to truly appreciate it is by keeping it separate and letting it stand alone. but in the end i have a renewed appreciation of both these albums and i now think they are both great.,1
ok computer is an absolutely fascinating album. it is one of those you listen to and really cannot believe what you have just heard. rich deep melodic and beautiful.,1
everything i could possibly say about this album has already been said over the past 9 years. however everything i could possibly say about this album would be to the point of urging you to own this album. this album is as essential as they make out!,1
if only this album was not so well know. then it would definetly be the highest ranked album on this website with a rating in the region of 4.75.,1
fitter. happier. more productive. a pig in a cage on antibiotics...el poema de fin de siglo. una obra maestra conceptual un paisaje literario del ciber-punk la sociedad moderna fra desinteresada ultra-tecnologica productivista consumista asfixiante colosales urbales al borde del colapso todo debe tener su procedimiento cada persona reducida a una cifra cada sentimiento ajustado a su momento... cada actividad debe estar programada ser ms feliz ms eficiente ms productivo... el escalosfro de saber que es verdad...,1
let me start off first by saying that this is probably my favorite album of all time none in my collection top this one the first song is already genious it is about the fear of car wrecks and to think it is about the happiest song on the whole album i knew from the moment i first heard it that this was something special it then follows up with paranoid android which is one of my favorite tracks on the album i love how it starts off rather quiet then it ends loud the following song reminds me of pink floyd in ways thinking how spaced out and trippy it is exit music for a film is another favorite of mine i like how it builds later in the song it reminds me of the tragic scenes in movies where someone dies. let down is another great song then karma police kicks in which is one argubly the best track on the album. the album is a simple masterpiece and just when i thought it could not get any better i heard no suprises which is a peaceful song yet it sounds rather depressing another masterpiece. this is without a doubt one of the best albums ever if you do not own it rush out and buy it.,1
if your going to buy a radiohead cd this is the one. you get subdued in the music. more guitar work here than any other album,1
perfect albums do not exist but this is one of the nearest to reach perfection,1
i got this album out of pure curiosity after i read an article on spin magazine saying that this was considered the best album of the last 25 years...until that moment the only things i knew of radiohead were creep...and kid a...and nothing else...and then ok computer starts playing and from that moment i had found a really great band to listen to...it is hard to explain how it sounds..maybe someone has already defined it better maybe even perfectly...i just like to think of the sound of ok computer has the sound of great music... this opened my eyes to a new world of music...and i have to say thanks for that!,1
i actually learned about radiohead through kid a and i found it acceptable with some great songs and some very dull songs. imagine my surprise when i heard that radiohead had albums that were actually genius original and downright classic! so i went to sounds our local and great musicstore at about 14.00 took the album to sample it. what happened then is blank i do not know exactly accept for that it was ecstatic. but about 14.30 when i woke up from my apparent trance because of some mechanical voice what turned out to be fitter happier i decided that this was a fantastic album. the good things i heard were actually true! little did i know that fitter happier was a turning point and not for the better! but still it was not a mistake to buy the album the first half of the album makes it more then alright and the great songs became even greater over time and obviously the songs i did not like became slightly better too. favorite track i know very clich but it is paranoid android,1
very nice album with some classic material. radiohead at its best emotional musically to the dot and composition-wise excellent! much better than the rather ordinary the bends which does not give that bit extra that a classic album needs except for some brilliant songs like street spirit. this album keeps the listener interested and satisfied and by that standard is surely the dark side of the moon of the 90s.,1
ok computer-now here is a classic album. this is the album that really made radiohead superstars and for good reason. i slightly prefer the bends to this one but i still give it a perfect five stars. ok computer certainly takes some getting used to but it is really worth it. my top 3 songs on this album are paranoid android airbag no surprises but it is hard picking only 3 songs off a record where nearly everything is perfect. overall my 2nd favorite radiohead album and a must-own for any fan of radiohead or rock in general. 1010,1
ahh....reviewing ok computer. odds are you have heard this album before especially if you are here. if you have not you should give this at least 3 listens please? word of warning it is not like anything else from the 90s it is not straight forward and it is its own genre of rock. if you find out you like this you truly have great taste in music. the album for me starts at paranoid android. i have never been too big on airbag as it does not do the album justice. airbags a great song but you will soon see that it will not compare to the un-earthly sounds you will hear in the tracks to come. paranoid android is complex original crisp nostalgic etc. it is really tough to get a full grasp on everything this song is and describing it to someone who is never heard it is close to impossible. if you have not though i would say it is like watching a sunset in the fall somewhere in new england when the leaves have all changed color probably late october. then something hits you like a baseball or a rock and you go unconscious. you have a strange dream while you are out but then you realize you are dreaming and you scramble to try to gain consciousness. yeah that is it.  subterranean homesick alien is great but not nearly on the same level as paranoid android. i feel bad for it because it has to follow the best song of its decade yet it is still unique and carefree though not as intense as paranoid android was. this is probably the best song to get high to on the entire album due to it is calming happy feel. exit music for a film rounds out the big 3 tracks on ok computer. it is like subterranean homesick alien but with more earthly sounds and a darker feel probably the most depressing song on the album yet still one of the most beautiful. the next 6 tracks can not compare to beginning of the cd but among them the ones that stand out the most are karma police and no surprises. fitter happier is a very cool song at first because of the lyrics and the overall layout of the song but it is probably the only song on the track the wears on me after all these years of listening. luckily it is a very short track the shortest on the album. lucky and the tourist seem more low-key and have very similar songs. it is almost a transition into the less experimental style you will hear on kid a.,1
ok computer is often referred to as one of the if not the best album of the 90s still makes top ten lists all over the damn place and still sells like hotcakes. the funny part is it is not overrated at all. it is one of the best albums i have heard it deserves to be recognized for what it is. of course anyone expecting commercialized alt-pop should stay away from this thing it is weird. some of it is depressing. but weird and depressing in a strikingly original even brilliant kind of way. fave tracks the whole damn thing is great but airbag lucky and karma police.,1
por mucho que lo escuche nunca llego al fondo cuanto ms ahondo ms matices le encuentro. disco cumbre de los 90 absorbente y obsesionante supuso un punto de inflexin para gran parte de la escena musical. estamos ante el disco que l solito se encarg de destrozar a todas las bandas de brit pop por antonomasia blur suede oasis the verve... la moda predominante por aquel entonces. ninguna de esas bandas fue capaz de asimilar el nuevo camino que abra el ok computer y vieron como aquella banda a la que haban eclipsado 3 aos atrs les adelantaba con un disco que se alejaba de todo lo hecho en los 90 hasta ese momento. el triunfo de radiohead no radica en el xito y el reconocimiento de este disco lo que yo valoro es que lo lograran siendo fieles a sus principios sin dejarse influenciar por las modas. de haber fracasado habran muerto con las botas puestas.,1
fucking great album i am going to. this is what anathema started sound more like on a fine day to exit,1
to start this review i would like to say how nice it is that stephen hawking would make a guest appearance on this album. how nice. although fitter happier is not a very good song it is nice hearing the voice of a genius. so i did not like this as much as many people do. i do not like some of the songs. my favorite would be karma police which sounds alot like sexy sadie by the beatles. my second favorite paranoid android. it is just a little too bland to be my favorite and a bit too long. so this album is very good i just do not like it. there is a difference. so i would not hesitate to buy this album. it may be your favorite. it just is not for me. it is not like i hate this album it is that i do not find interest in it. so... there.,1
masterpiece is a bit strong - thom yorkes vocals are quite far from perfect - but this album is outstanding. if you like it check out the bends as well! it is about as excellent as this one.,1
despite this album regularly coming top in various british music press best album in the world lists it is brilliant. however not only is it not the best album in the world it is not the best album by radiohead. it is the second best album by radiohead. the best radiohead album is without a shadow of a doubt the bends. this album is more the wall than the dark side of the moon of the 1990s. powerful disorientating and claustrophobic this is the sound of thom york singing as the wall closes around.,1
this is a perfect album. just like the cover art of abbey road any modification would destroy it. my suspicion is upheld by for example the transition from the tension present in exit music for a film to the tranquility of let down and many other gigantic moments i am yet to discover because every listen is a surprise.,1
the ultimate statement on a modernized life.,1
you know what? i am reading a lot of reviews about people saying this album is overrated. okay it is probably not the best album of all times like the q magazine likes to blabber about one should never trust the british press they keep foreseeing the new nirvana since kurt cobain died every single day - but i think that is personal. to me it is the best album ever since it is a perfect record. everythings there great melodies deep lyrics amazing guitar work original arrangements shinny production... everything. it shows radiohead in it is best form even if ok computer almost killed the band. and it is an album completely filled with emotion i shiver everytime i listen to let down or subterranean homesick alien. i feel like screaming together with thom yorke on climbing up the walls and holding my breath in no surprises. it is such an epic that can be interpreted as a concept album with fitter happier dividing two sides of one masterpiece. the a side being thom yorke showing how our world is becoming and the intense angst he feels with it. the b side is the screaming of the ending the way that even if we try something we will end up getting nowhere not being able to do a single thing. masterpieces have multiple interpretations. ok computer is one of those it can even be interpreted as a bunch of good songs put together with no context between them. or even as a loosely concept album with thom yorke internalizing political affairs and showing them in a completely personal way wich is what i believe and what i realize to be a genius work. thom yorke itself hates ok computer he once said ok computer is no longer a radiohead album but instead an album made by the people who love it. only masterpieces have that power. ok computer has.,1
ok computer is an absolute masterpiece. radiohead had established themselves as one of the worlds best bands with the 1995 release the bends but it was ok computer that showcased an amazing series of musically elaborate and groundbreaking tracks. the epic three-part paranoid android effortlessly shifts in tempo and emotion while subterranean homesick alien exhibits a beautiful mellow guitar hook that builds to an explosive climactic chorus. the atmospheric brilliance continues with the wrenching exit music the strange and comedic but infectiously catchy karma police and the breathtaking and sweeping lucky. ok computer also contained the 1990s most culturally significant lyrical themes especially in the bizarre gripping fitter happier. simply put this album focuses on the growing presence of technology i.e. the computer in society and its growing control of the masses. still regardless of theme ok computer is a masterful set of adventurous musical arrangements and superb melodies and is most definitely the best record of its time.,1
when this album first came out i really enjoyed the music but the singers voice totally turned me off. i just could not listen to it and i always found it a shame because the music was incredible. now almost ten years later i gave it another try and the first retry i thought it was tolerable then a second spin totally hooked me and now i would not change the voice for anything. the pure genius behind ok computer would simply be lost.,1
ok computer is an album with an incredible reputation one i feel it almost lives up to. radiohead are masters of filling out songs with little nuances that keep the music fresh after repeated listening. the music is fairly dense there is a lot going on here and a true appreciation of the album only comes through repeated listenings. basically with this album radiohead branched away from the alternative guitar rock sound of the bends. traces of that sound are still here but are filled out by other elements - new sound combinations and a much wider instrumentation. the band were much more innovative and creative with this album but did not sacrifice the great melodies that made the bends so great. the lush production values also make the album and absolute pleasure to listen to it really is a treat on the ears. thom yorkes smooth distinctive voice is beautiful to listen to and fits into radioheads sound like a glove. the instrumentation is also very creative with some great innovative guitar playing and awesome effects that add to the songs. the songs themselves are all beautiful individual and powerful pieces of music. there is a sense of sadness about the record which varies from the detached melancholy of karma police to the full on depressive suicide that is exit music. with the exception of the rocking electioneering the album is quite slow and reflective resulting in a great flowing listening experience. the only thing that may put people off is fitter happier... a robotic spoken word piece with some background effects. it fits into the album well in my opinion and i do not mind listening to it along with the rest of the music. paranoid android may be the most innovative thing here it is a multi part epic comparable to stuff like bohemian rhapsody and really is something. i have not even mentioned half of the songs and the great things they do. really the album is a classic and will be remembered by future generations. when a band changes their sound into something more arty often things like melody and good song structure are comprimised. with ok computer radiohead made the transition to a different sound perfectly which resulted in one of the best albums of the 90s.,1
i have mixed feelings of radiohead in general but nevertheless ok computer is very good. what i love most of this album is their ability to perform subtle transitions with such complexity. the songs are performed with layers upon layers of texture that are so well composed it makes me think i need to have a degree in music theory to fully appreciate their music technically. there are periods when the album reaches a pinnacle with letdown and lucky which are probably some of their best songs. yes their music is depressing and emotionally wearing usually not my style. but some people take their music a little too seriously and find it a reflection of some of their tragic lives - please. they have created such an obsessed fan base of intellectual poseurs. radiohead can be pretentious which i have no problem with but some radiohead fans act pompous as a result of liking them. its attractive to the modern day college minds that like to discuss the watered down problems of decaying human society.,1
i would not say this is one of the best albums ever recorded in fact i got angry when i listened to it for the first time it did not lived to my expectations but these guys know their craft the arrangements are very imaginative although sometimes they get predictable and the music dwells on commonplace melodies for example in karma police which is very beatle. ok computer has one master piece paranoid android,1
i have just finished listening to ok computer for the nth time and while this exceptional album is fresh in my memory i guess i should talk about it. i am sure many other people can and have done a much better review of this album but i would just like to say this give it a try. i think the album needs at least 3 listens before you realise how good it is and after that you are in for a treat. i guess the reason this album remains so playable time after time is because of the amount of thought behind it. it is beautifully crafted each song containing many layers of sound that mean whenever you listen there is something new to discover. i will not go into the album track by track but i would say that i think the album has a very good mixture of songs that you almost instantly like in my case airbag let down karma police and i guess no surprises to those that take a while to grow on you i used to really dislike exit music but now it is one of my favourites in the album and the touristis such a beautiful way to end an album perhaps even better than street spirit. perhaps an album hyped up so much like ok computer will never really be exceptional enough to justify the exaggerations of fans but for me it is an album to treasure.,1
just because it is overrated does not mean it is no good. quite enjoyable and inventive if you can get past the amazing amount of hype that has come its way. and also overcome thom yorkes at times almost unbearable self-pitying whine. but i rather like it ... somehow though they are almost always better live when they just let go and get down and what have you. well that was then and this is now.,1
i like the experiment-y feel to the album-some great great songs but maybe a bit difficult for me to listen to all the way through.,1
do not listen to this on a sunny cheerful day. listen to it when you are angry and sad about school work and basically about how humans are made to live. it can save your life. fitter happier is the best track on the album. people say it is a self-indulgent jerkoff but that is only because they do not get it. it is very powerful.,1
great album the beat of the last 10 years. if you take out flitter happy and exit music the album is perfect and i would have gave it 5 stars. best songs paronoid andoriod karma police let down,1
while more predictable than their later work it nevertheless one of the most emotionally intense albums i have heard. sort of takes me back to my teenage years. not a good thing but intense.,1
it is not better than in the aeroplane over the sea but it will do.,1
took a while to get into but i now consider this album a classic. best songs include- karma police and paranoid android.,1
con independencia de que llegar una generacin que lo odiar con toda su alma es un disco increble en todos los sentidos. el mejor disco de todos los tiempos? pues mira probablemente.,1
this album not only lives up to its incredible hype it actually surpasses it. in my opinion ok computer is a flawless record. i am a huge radiohead fan and this album is a big reason why. the music is very powerful and it always draws my attention. the balance of light and heavy guitars with electricprog sounds really makes it unique and revolutionary. the songs are stellar. the big tracks paranoid android and karma police are both incredible. my personal favorites are exit music climbing the walls and no surprises. the vocals thom yorke delivers are amazing throughout the entire album. he is a truly talented singer he shines in every setting. all in all this album is 5 stars no question. there is no reason why you should not atleast give this a listen. let the genius sink in before you judge it.,1
there is a solid argument to be made that this is the greatest album of all time. most great albums e.g. revolver sgt. pepper nevermind blonde on blonde loveless pet sounds ziggy stardust are great because were a departure from everything that came before and they changed the course of music. ok computer did not however change the course of music. it is unassailable a peak that not even radiohead themselves can presume to attempt again. it would have been equally or more astonishing in any year before or since its release. try saying that about any other album.,1
back when i was only a young lad well say five years ago i heard all about this radiohead band and how ok computer is truly one of the great albums of our time. and i never disagreed as i had never heard anything from radiohead. so last year i decided it was time to give them a listen as by the law of averages i like muse placebo the cure they should be my sort of band. ok computer was the second radiohead album i bought after amnesiac. like many other people i found that i did not quite see how it could be rated so highly. i thought it was good but not one of the best ever good. so i continued to listen to it. and it grew on me of course. in a way some songs became a sort of soundtrack to my life. i lived by them listened to them over and over again. and they continued to grow on me. so i decided to dig deeper and analyse the concept of ok computer. and what i found made the album grow on me further. the dehumanization and constraints of society and progress. you listen to the lyrics listen to the sounds which they have placed beneath it all listen to everything that you can possibly hear and then do it all again. and then the overwhelming pain sets in what has happened to our world where we live our lives how we are told by the powers that be? fitter happier sums it up best i suppose. sure it can be discarded as a meaningless piece of filler but it is actually anything but. that two minutes of computerized vocals and melodramatic piano is ok computer. it is the core of the album. that is why it separates the first half from the second half. so do not just skip it every time. listen and think. now getting past that this album is a true masterpiece of intelligence and talent. it is comfortable yet frantic. peaceful yet conflicted. the simplicity of songs such as let down and no surprises is so confronting that it hurts. it lowers your spirits and makes your heart ache while still making you feel so happy and grateful that you could hear a piece of music that can make you feel that way. whether another band will be able to compete with this album in this genre ever again is unlikely. it seems that even radiohead will not be able to. this album is the apex of the britrock genre. listen to it and appreciate the fact that you have been blessed with the ability to listen to it. best three tracks from ok computerif you can name three standouts! 1. let down 2. climbing up the walls 3. paranoid android,1
canciones favoritas paranoid android karma police exit music for a film,1
i give it 4 stars for the reason of paranoid android. what a great song! the rest is ok but i tend to prefer amnesiac,1
it is absolutely tough for me to still imagine how 7600 random people who rated this album give an average of 4.41 rating i mean its almost impossible impossible in the sense that this album has such musical and emotional depth that i can hardly convince myself that all these people would connect to this album so easily i mean i would understand if 80 of the people would say that they love the beatles and their hum able songs but this one is hardly anywhere close to that it actually took me a long time to get used to this album and then love it and then feel the depth that it carries. i bought this one at the time when i was going through a very depressing time and probably that is the only time when anyone could possibly likelove this album. i would even go on to say that somehow in a strange way kid a is much more catchier than this album i repeat catchy maybe not an easier listen but that album stick in your head more than this one. for me this album and the pink floyds the division bell opened the gates to a whole new world how music draws new emotions. there are couple of really intellectual songs like karma police and climbing up the walls mixed with really really emotional songs like exit music and lucky and sad song like no surprises this is a milestone when it comes to my passion in music after listening to this album for straight 6 months and nothing else i remember that everything that i heard on tv and radio would sound pale even sour. still hard for me to imagine that radiohead is selling so many cds and loved by so many makes me doubt if those fans are actually fans or just posers !,1
for the 558the time this is a flawless piece of work that cements radiohead at the forefront of not only the british alt. rock scene but of the rock scene in general. wonderful layered tracks that grow and grow on you. as i say a great album that is even forgivven for fitter happier which frankly i just do not get with the likes of no surprises and my personal highlight of the album paranoid android which in my view is highly underrated. you are not a lover of music until you appreciate this album. this review is nothing you have not heard before but just thort i should reinforce the fact..... you run out of superlatives for this album and get bored.,1
favourite tracks let down favourite ever song by anybody no surprises lucky the b sides disc is also brilliant showing that they had quality by the megatonne.,1
it is no secret that this is one if the best of the best albums of all time just check the top 1000 albums of all time on this very website... 7!. i have listened to this album close to every day for the last two years and i still marvel at it is genius!! it is a perfect blend of every radiohead album... halfway in between the bends and some songs climbing up the walls stray near the kid a era. it is brilliant album and everyone should get acquainted with it!! best songs all of them!!! but paranoid android lucky exit music and the tourist are my favourites!,1
unlike many british albums from the ninteties ok computer has aged like fine wine. today the themes of paranoia expressed on this masterpiece are more striking than ever. radiohead supports their concept with their most progressive musical effort to this point in their career. the songs are instantly memorable - moments such as the opening riff to airbag the cathartic climax of exit music for a film the anguished screaming in climbing up the walls and the epic closer the tourist grab hold from the first spin and do not let go. no album has achieved such passion focus intelligence and complexity all in one package as well as this one has.,1
so much has been said already. personally i like the bends slightly better but it does not prevent ok computer from being a classic album. try to sing no surprises exit music for a film or lucky without crying at the end. every track on this album has at one point been my favorite. thom yorke takes you to a journey into his head. it is a sad place but not one you want to leave.,1
first heard this cd in march of 2005. i was curious about the disc notes and lyrics and i discovered this website httpwww.ateaseweb.com everything that i wanted and more is this website. i have rated all of rh a 4 with the exception of pablo honey r2 and hail to the thief r5,1
their best album. tragical magical sad. do not listen to it when you are depresed and remember that you will not like radiohead when you have only listened to them once or twice!,1
el ok computer es considerado por la mayoria el mejor disco de radiohead. y con justa razon es un album con canciones clasicas de los 90s lo puedes escuchar de principio a fin y no te aburres. muchos pensaron q en the bends ya podian tener una obra maestra pero lo mejor estaba por venir. es de ese tipo de musica q la puedes escuchar y realmente te impresionas. radiohead fue encajado injustamente en el britpop pero en realidad su musica es unica. este es un disco q tal vez no sea muy facil de digerir a la primera pero creo q a la tercera escuchada ya lo acabaras amando. hay muchos tracks impresindibles. mis favoritas son paranoid android subterranean homesick alien y exit music for a film.,1
reviews are irrelevant. what really matters sic - mattered is ignored in time in exchange for slick language ego and personal bias. okcomputer  headphones  sonic bliss,1
one of my college roommates used to make fun of another roommate for buying radioheads first album pablo honey on the strength of the single creep. the dismissive derider thought that radiohead was clearly a one hit wonder on the tail end of the grunge phenomenon and would never be heard from again. although i liked creep well enough i never bothered to listen to the album nor did i muster a counterargument. for all that i could tell he was right. a little while later i heard a different acquaintances copy of their second album the bends and was shocked by how good it was but i was too proud to go out and buy my own copy of it because i did not respect this dudes taste in music enough to allow myself to be so directly influenced by him! so i continued to resist becoming a radiohead fan until i heard the undeniably great karma police and paranoid android and just had to finally purchase this wonderful cd. i still remember where and when i made that purchase and recall that day whenever i pass by the store a big box next to an interstate where i pulled over on a whim on road trips. in short ok computer is absolutely deserving of its reputation as the dark side of the moon of the 90s. more specifically we get a great intro a la speak to mebreatheon the run in airbag that establishes some themes while not blowing us away but building up the anticipation with chord progressions and arrangements bringing unresolved tension. then on to the main feast on dark side we got the soaring epic time and here we get something arguably even better paranoid android is one of the greatest prog rock tracks ever produced whether radiohead actually likes prog or not!. i love the loose feel of the acoustic guitars throughout the early part of the song and colin greenwoods playful groove on the bass and as usual thom sings the hell out of this one and the lyrics! kicking screaming gucci little piggie! hell yes. but this all still just build up for the guitar riffagecarnage to follow jonny greenwoods lovetone meatball effect on the guitar solo absolutely kills. with gut-punches from time and paranoid android coming so soon after the albums introductions do both of these albums peak too early? a case could be made for that but they both attain great heights later too and function beautifully as cohesive listening experiences so i tend to think that the albums probably flowed best with these tracks in their respective places. and flow is a key similarity here in that both albums are better than the sum of their parts by virtue of the fact that they are both such superb bodies of work in their coherence and listenability on the whole even when they are bringing on some serious depression!. after the respective epics the albums continue to flow in similar directions for now as we get a bit of a break in the action on both albums and mellow out a bit with the breathe reprise at the end of time and the great gig in the sky on dark side and subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film and let down on ok computer. it is interesting how both great gig and exit music develop dazzle and dissolve in similar fashion both moving the listener in similar fashion due to the expert song-craft employed by these two amazing bands. next we get the albums big hits in money and karma police. beyond that distinction there is really not much of an honest comparison to be made between these tracks but we continue to see how similarly the albums flow anyway. and there is still plenty left to enjoy on both of these albums as we get moving slow songs about forms of isolation in no surprises and us and them. the albums close in distinctly different fashions much of this owing to the fact that dark side of the moon is a concept album with musical themes that are reintroduced rehashed and resolved whereas ok computer continues to explore new musical directions. this aspect of the comparison also feeds into the whole dark side of the moon of the 90s bit in that concept albums while they are still being made will probably forever be associated with the 1970s the decade in which dark side of the moon was released. if ok computer had been a concept album then the comparison probably would not have worked as well in terms of either its identity as a strong product of its times or of the widespread acceptance that it attained which are absolutely essential for this comparison. it is notable that ok computer was obtained and enjoyed by such a wide swathe of rock fandom even as represented by my own group of friends who have fairly divergent musical tastes because that is the kind of popularity that made dark side of the moon the cultural touchstone of its day too. just about everybody of certain ages who was into rock music at the time of these releases knows these albums and can be expected to be conversant on the topic even if they do not like them. i once dated an older woman who was convinced that i was someone else who was posting online merely because the other guy and i shared a mutual love of both radiohead and neil young she failed to understand how thoroughly unremarkable that is. name any major rock act plus pink floyd or radiohead and fans who share a love for both of them are going to be common. some may view it as a disservice to compare the albums in such direct fashion especially since despite the numerous comparisons there is zero evidence that radiohead was consciously aping or performing any sort of homage to pink floyd with this album so let me be perfectly clear that i only intend to present this comparison on the basis of commonalities that both of these great albums happen to share and which have resulted in a frequently made observation that proves true under scrutiny. radiohead definitely was not seeking to rehash any sort of 70s prog jonny greenwood reportedly does not even like dark side of the moon. relatively speaking radiohead who had started off sounded like a mishmash of u2 in a grunge direction with greater chops in evidence than either of those institutions was bringing something just as new and excellent if not even greater to the table as pink floyd had within the natural progression and context of their own musical abilities and influences. so now that we have that comparison out of the way so what? an album does not attain greatness in a vacuum so it is worth examining how it changed the musical landscape especially in the case of this particular album. the albums title represents an obvious concession to technology but this is still in large part a guitar album especially in comparison to the direction taken by the band later on kid a and amnesiac. still much was made of that title at the time and techno although it never really caught on in the states like the media claimed that it would seemed poised to dominate with the guitar reportedly on the verge of extinction. although that did not happen there definitely was a rash of successful radiohead clones popping up like doves travis and coldplay so in that respect the album has continued to influence the charts even though it never helped to usher in any sort of techno-age at all. however although guitar driven rock directly influenced by this album remains with us we may never see the likes of an album like ok computer and its widespread acceptance throughout rock fandom and influence on fellow musicians again. with the popularity of music downloading having hurt physical rock album sales it is evident that the dynamics of music sales have shifted appreciably and more rock fans are taking the opportunity to less expensively explore their own preferred niches making it far less likely that rock fans will come together over and fully absorb an album in such a fashion ever again. a few years after its release some all-time-greatest-album lists placed ok computer squarely at the top and although that has grown rarer i still would not have a problem with it.,1
the album that made me their real fan. ok computer earned them even the critics applauses,1
i really got nothing more to add to the conversation around this album other than that it is harder to think of an album that more succinctly sums up this certain mindset of a time period than this one. i am not talking pro or protest songs about a time but music that hits the pressure of living through it the mindset that comes from it. squashed like bugs? not a question of if but when? for how long? and how bad?,1
the greatest album ever although i would say the same thing for amnesiac too! airbag 8.510 a great intro to the best album ever! get you prepared for paranoid android! paranoid android 1010 a symbol of a classic radiohead song! this song is usually considered as the best song of radiohead although for me is one of the best. the most popular song of radiohead consists of three independent songs joint together delicately. the beginning part is an awesome classic rock song and then it becomes a hardcore rock following by one of the best melody drum ever made and at the end hardcore again. the song was initiated when thom was in a messy bar in la surrounded by annoying people as you can also guess from its video clip although the character in the video clip is robin made by a swedish director magnus carlsson. kicking and squealing gucci little piggy refers to a fat woman getting on thoms nerve in that bar. subterranean homesick alien 8.510 a good song! i cannot tell anymore about this one. usually the there are a couple of songs in radiohead albums at the beginning that are preparing you for more excitement! i think this song is one of them! exit music for a film 1010 a wonderful drum song! originally written for romeo and juliet movie the lyrics penetrates under your skin. there are some parts in the song that you really want to scream and cry. specially when the song gets more exciting you can laugh a spineless laugh  and then my favorite part of the songs comes up we hope your rules and wisdom choke you  overall i think it is the best drum song of radiohead played by guitar. let down 1010 hysterical and useless! simply the best! you have to listen to this song more and more and you love it more and more! just go to the busy part of the town and walk around! look at the people around you and listen to this song. one of the good things i love about this song is that it gets better and better as it goes. my favorite part is the last section of it you know you know where you are with you know where you are with floor collapses floating bouncing back and one day i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction hysterical and useless karma police 1010 this is what you get when you mess with us! this song is probably the most famous song of radiohead after creep. i have not seen anyone listen to this song for the first time and do not agree that it is a wonderful song! so it is the best song if you want to introduce radiohead to the beginners! however when you get involved in radiohead more you do not listen to it much often the same thing about creep too! because they are different from other radiohead songs! they are wonderful rock songs however different from other songs! they are the best for the follower groups of radiohead coldplay travis muse kean  to have an idea how to write a song but they can never get close to it. as chris martin coldplay singer says about the new era of brit rock i think if you imagine radiohead going through a jungle clearing a path then we are the ones who are probably just criminally paving it. i always see radiohead as the braver people. fitter happier 8.510 this is probably the weirdest song in ok computer. although there is some music in the background the song is mostly influenced by the lyrics. all the shit that we have to care everyday we hear it in tv radio reading in magazines newspapers... another interesting thing about this song is that in the whole song you think you have to do what the computer like preacher is telling you. but at the end the sentence comes like a pig in a cage on antibiotics electioneering 810 it is a good hard rock song! but i am not a huge fan of it! climbing up the walls 9.510 this song has gained lots of attractions among radiohead fans. it is different from other songs of the album but i would say electioneering is a good intro to this song. the rhythm and the lyrics of the main part usually remain in your mind for a while if you listen to this song for a few times. no surprises 910 i really feel i am the guy thom is talking about a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruisers that will not hill the lyrics in this song is extremely depressing however the music itself is not that depressing compare to other songs like tourist exit music and lucky in this album. the instrument that is used in this song is glockenspiel. one of the songs that is good to present to rookie radiohead listeners. lucky 9.510 this is a great drum song composed just in a couple of days for the album war child. this album was created by various artists for the children of war in bosnia. tourist 9.510 this song is mostly composed by johny. it was inspired when the group was in paris and they saw tourists specially americans passing by at thousand feet per second without noticing the marvelous beauty of paris and it made johnny crazy hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down this is a perfect song for ending the best album in the history! usually the last song of radiohead albums are different from the others and usually are welcomed by a wide-rang of music tastes. street spirit was like this in the bends.,1
this is simply the best album i have ever heard! i can not describe how much i love this album. to say it changed my life would be a cheesy comment though a true one. thank you radiohead.,1
i think in 2035 this album will be regarded as the beatles revolver is today. a spectacular timeless piece of music and a perfect mirror or witness? of its time. what more can be asked from a pop album?,1
so this has been one of those few chart things that has always bothered me. i do not get how this is the 1 album on this site. do i like ok computer? yes. do i think ok computer belongs in the top 100? sure. top 10? maybe. number 1? no definitely not. my own history with ok computer i was a college radio dj in 1997. i was friends with the stations music director and i remember him mentioning to me in the spring of 97 that radiohead had a new album coming out soon that he heard great things about. i still only knew radiohead as a one-hit wonder and had heard very little about them since creep which i liked. after returning to school and my beloved radio show the next fall i do not remember even seeing a new radiohead album on the rotation. the real radio station in our area 97x later known as woxy.com did not play ok computer. i never heard anything about this album until 2000 or 2001 when it began to gain its legendary status. my own rating of this record has gone up and down over the years. i like it but it is not a record i ever reach for or get a strong desire to listen to. i got more into radiohead after kid a came out and i went back and listened to ok computer. i have since realized something about radiohead. their albums sound really great the first time but they do not seem to age well. while ok computer has never been a go-to album for me i do find that this is the one radiohead album that does age well and i somewhat reluctantly admit that it is improving with age.,1
paranoid android is one of the most incredible songs ever released but this album is slightly overrated and hence should appear in any top ten album lists.....,1
quality stuff! the purely rocky sound of the bends has been changed slightly and made a bit more experimental and a bit more electronic and that is not a bad thing at all. it has a very unique sound which only radiohead seem to produce and exaggerate massively on albums such as amnesiac and has some truly classic tracks on it paranoid android karma police no surprises electioneering lucky if you consider yourself a music fan own this album!,1
amazing incredible. without any doubt one of the greatest albums of the 90s and in my opinion of the whole history of music.,1
paranoid android owns your souls.,1
the bends might have been one of the nineties best guitar rock albums but taking into account the mediocrity of pablo honeyi radiohead in 1997 were only ever a band to watch. however from the moment ok computer was put into c.d players across the country it pushed radiohead into that spot where only few artists reach. the albums opener is arguably the most powerful track on the album. from the moment airbag starts you realise you are listening to something completely new and fantastic. this follows with paranoid android which remains to this day one of radioheads most experimental and ambitious no pun intended tracks. while subeterranean homesick alien is undoubtedly the albums low point it still contains some of the most interesting radiohead lyrics written. this is answered with exit music for a film an incredibly dark account of the last scene to romeo and juliet and the albums high point. the following let down is a feel good song which would have fitted on one of radioheads former albums and karma police is the most accessible and catchy songs on the album. after fitter happier  a short poem said in a stephen hawking like voice we have a quick return to the rocky guitar sound of the earlier albums with electioneering. this is then answered by climbing up the walls another dark track which sees thom yorke even scream towards the end of the track. no surprises is disputedly radioheads greatest moment with its plinky-plonky guitar riff and glockenspeill. its comments on nineties life as well as the mixture of light guitar riffs and dark lyrics sum up this album brilliantly. lucky is another song that uses guitar spectacularly yet this time it is softer and more meaningful. the final track the tourist contains some of the best lyrics on the album and is a chilling end to a chilling album. this album is undoubtedly radioheads best and will probably never be bettered by the now heavily abstract band. ok computer is simply fantastic. its dark themes inlude comments on the pre-millenium world office jobs computers and mobile phones. radioheads ok computer was predicted to be the last proper rock album ever as the world fast became engulfed by techno sounds and napster. they were wrong but it remains radioheads last word in conventional rock and an album which is now widely considered to be the best ever.,1
bueno sin lugar a dudas se nota un gran cambio a comparacin de sus discos predecesores un thom york mucho ms suelto e innovador le toma la posta al rockero del the bends. jonny greenwood confirma en airbag la cancin con la que abre este excepcional disco ser el complemento perfecto de yorke. paranoid android es el clmax tempranero del disco y da comienzo a lo que ms adelante sera el indie electrnico. de ahi en adelante solo queda disfrutar de una serie de armonas bien estructuradas. ojo no esperes escuchar un disco de rock ni nada parecido al the bends porque no lo encontrars este es un trabajo mucho mas limpio y depurado... es un disco completo no hay desperdicio. haciendo una analoga con pink floyd este album sera su dark side of the moon.,1
even though i hardly listen to it anymore i still feel that this album deserves every praise as a masterpiece. emotionally i am in a different place from where i was when i really got into this album that is why it seems i do not connect to the whiny thom yorke mood anymore but musically this still is a wonderful album which used to mean a lot to me.,1
urban dystopia par excellencei. this is rightly regarded as the best british album of the 90s. it transcends the bands preceding albums and still makes something new and interesting of its obvious influences particularly pink floyd. stands together fantastically as an album as it has a coherent sound which includes lots of great individual songs but these do not detract from from the overall intensity and consistency of the album. lyrically and musically as good as music got in the 1990s. listening to it occasionally now but the pain and glory still shines through.,1
i cannot stand people who say it is not that good or that it is over-rated almost every song on this album is a classic especially the first six. unlike anything else ever it is under-rated if anything.,1
great great cd. always can come back to it and it never gets old.there is not a bad track on the whole cd.even fitter happier adds some lever of creppieness that i love.,1
i previously had a review that went on about how this album says a lot about britain in the nineties and how it is essential. but i deleted that because i decided it was pointless not to mention poorly written. i mean let us be honest - there is not much chance of me being able to change your mind about radiohead. you either think they are a band who are capable of changing lives or you think they are a bunch of whiny students who should try getting a proper job. there are a few in the middle ground but there is bound to be - over 2500 ratings - this is an all pervading album. you have heard about it a million times already probably from many people more expressive than i could ever be. anyway ignorantium said it all better in his review. go read that sorry about breaking reviewing guidelines but it really is a good review.,1
one of the best albums ever if i had the chance to give it a sixth star i would have done it. in an era where everything is so already said and there is only bad stuff going on these guys said something different. thank you guys. thank you for making me believe in music and in its future again.,1
ok computer is radioheads third album and also possibly their most famous. it serves as a transition between their earlier grunge and punk influenced albums pablo honey and the bends and their more avant-garde albums kid a and amnesiac. as far as songs go it is second to none containing several of the bands most popular tracks. it features paranoid android karma police and exit music for a film. on many tracks radiohead combines conventional 5 piece rock music with electronic sounds and beats that provide a listening experience that is not soon to be forgotten. notable tracks paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police lucky buy or borrow? buy,1
radioheads second best album. the first one is certainly the bends. karma police could easily be evaluated as one of the best songs ever made. but the whole album is a bit overrated.,1
beautiful haunting and mesmerizing...buy this album if you do not own it.,1
deepr and more artsy than the first two albums drawing on influences from real life situations shakespeare and personal jokes within the band that become personal messages. won album of the year in japan and in my opinion this one remains unmatched by any artist. the style changes a bit from catchy rock to darker more meaningful music. brilliant!!!,1
one of the most innovative and ambitious albums of all time. much more complex than the bends but not necessarily better. like comparing pulp fiction with reservoir dogs. one cannot but admire the scope of the album but some of the purity of the older album is lost on the way. actually the only real drawback to this album is that it is too breathtaking for one to listen to it more than once at a time. it exhausts your energies completely - which again is not necessarily a bad thing.,1
simply one of the greatest albums of all timeby a group of incredible musicians.jonny greenwood is also the best guitarist in the world today. i would write a full review outlining how it earns its reputation but it has all been said before.,1
one of the few on repeat albums that i do not really tire of hearing.,1
a great album sure but perhaps overated. nowhere near as good as kid a.,1
the bends is a great album and this weird point where brit pop and us alternative rock meet in seemingly perfect harmony. i really think that had radiohead stuck to that formula nobody would have minded too much. everyone or nearly everyone would have been perfectly happy with the bends ii. and the bends would have just been regarded as their best album. instead they made this record. adding prog rock post rock and post punk though there was some of that earlier influences to their sound as well as a lyrical concept that perhaps feels even more significant and prescient than it did at the time. it is a masterpiece - rarely do music and lyrics mesh so well rarely do the lyrics of a band feel like lasting insights - and one of the great records of the 1990s. it outdoes the bends on every level one would have thought that an impossible feat and established radiohead as something much more than just a brit pop band unduly influenced by grunge. it is not their best record in my mind which sounds insane given the praise i just gave it but it is very close and it is as essential as any 90s rock album.,1
being hailed as one of the best albums in 1990s ok computer is bound to get many reviews in which it is said to be overrated. this is not one of them. it might not be the best album ever and it is actually a kind of transition album between the guitar-heavy radiohead and more electronic one but it is a very good album. it makes the most of the unique haunting soundscape combined of electronic noises and both acoustic and distorted guitars. ok computer begins with the atmospheric airbag one of the few positive songs on the album. it is a close relative to planet telex from the bends. then things are getting stranger and gloomier. paranoid android is melancholic to the extreme with occasional guitar-driven outbursts. subterranean homesick alien is a solid alternative rock song that gets better after a few listens. exit music is an evil slowly growing brooding song. as it is said in the lyrics it gives such a chill. the rest of the material is equally good with the exceptions of boring climbing up the walls and lucky a bittersweet ballad that somehow does not quite get off the ground. the album ends brilliantly with the tourist an overlooked gem of a song.,1
radioheads triumphant farewell to somewhat conventional rock this album stands out as a modern rock classic.,1
i have heard how great this album is and it did not dissapoint. much better than kid a which is extremely boring after you listen to it once. it show the more musical side in them not just a lot of random noises like kid a. the guitar was gret in a lot of songs especially paranoid android. my favorite song was electioneering.,1
ah what can someone say about this album that has not been mentioned in the past 8 years of its existence. it is simply a flawless album a modern-day classic and an undying flame in a forest of darkness. ok computer instills hope in having something come out in the mainstream that is extraordinary thrilling uncompromising and most of all artistic in its truest sense. this record makes you wonder how most of the mainstream rock at the time i.e. bush stone temple pilots korn was even digestable by our fragile virgin ears. it seems like those bands made music for primates while radiohead has made an album that transcends space and time. each song sparkles with melodic brilliance and never is there a song that does not involve even a tiny bit of thinking outside the box. from the dj-shadow-esque drum beats of airbag to the minimalistic use of the glockenspiel in no surprises the album is a consistent step forward. the melodies gush all over the place from the distorted voice of thom in climbing up the walls to his fragile tone in subterranean homesick alien one of my personal favourites in their entire catalog. the lyrics flirt with genius from lines like ambition makes you look pretty ugly to i will take a quiet lifea handshake of carbon monoxide and they clearly have a unity to them revolving around the themes of robots and their effects on human emotionspersonality. it may take a while to adjust to their complex sound and the subtle gimmicks they employ on each song but when you tap into the goods congratulations. you have just reached valhalla and there is no turning back. i always envision that on the day when space travel to the moon is successful for common folk i will immerse myself in ok computer and ask the pilot to show me the world as i would love to see it.,1
yep good cd songs are just good and catchy radiohead are a good band people should check them out...,1
an amazing album. the paranoid riffs blend perfectly with yorkes vocals. a complete album even considering the average tracks subterranean homesick alien the tourist and airbag although i would agree this album deserves to receive best album of the last two decades. i would find it hard to argue this against some of dylans best work or even revolver. my favourite track is exit music for a film the song used at the end of romeo  juliet. karma police paranoid android and no surprises were well chosen singles to give the public an idea of this album. no one should not have this album in their collection. it really is a must have. many fans wish the band would return to this style of songwriting. however if you were the band and had created this album there would be no-where to go except criticism for sounding like their last album. this is why i believe they changed tack completely for kid a,1
this is a perfect album. there are not a lot of perfect albums from the 90s but this is one of them. everything and i mean everything is right on ok computer. in fact radiohead kind of fucked themselves over with this album because they will never be able to top it.,1
do not go ballistic! 4 stars is a very good rating. i love this album it has impact but their later albums have ideas. ok computers music and art are all of a package and that package seems to imply an idea but i cannot help but feel there is a pink floyd thing going on here. you know sounds great when it first comes out but does not age well. drop those torches! i treasure my copy i just think that in 20 years i will still be playing kid a and amnesiac and possibly the bends on a regular basis and will break out ok computer once a year when similarly-aged friends are all gathered round in the gameroom in the basement enjoying whatever intoxicant is in vogue at the time and we can all smile and sigh and talk about what a wonderful age that was and how the young peckerwoods of today get away with everything. five years ago i would have given this five stars and spoken of it as a classic. but now that i have found gods face on the play-side of the compact disc of peter brotzmanns machine gun i cannot bring myself to prostrate myself in obedience with the rest of the masses. that said it is a classic.,1
it took about 24 hours for this album to change the way i look at music in a way pretty much no album ever has. there are just songs on this album that sound like nothing i have ever heard even from other radiohead albums. every track is great yes even fitter happier if for nothing else than to contribute to the overall tone of the album and i can find nothing wrong with it. part pink-floydish suite part chaotic emotional thrill ride. quite frankly the best thing i have ever heard.,1
1010 - this is my first radiohead album i have listened to. after all the publicity i have heard about it i expected it to be pretty good. it took me a couple of listens to finally see why this album is so special. this is the best album i have ever heard. you will be amazed at how superb this album really is. i could not just listen to a few songs on the album i would have to listen to the whole thing because it is so good. all of the tracks are very good and fit perfectly together. however i really like the tracks climbing up the walls and lucky.,1
one of the best ever. i just hope that they produce one more album with similar music before they disband.,1
monumental release for the british press when it was first released and for some reason it is still believed to be one of the finest most perfect albums ever. not really. on the initial listen it was impressive but after years and years of repeated and occasional listening it is just simple somber pop music. there are some excellent tracks like paranoid android and let down but after that it is just real drawn out. luckily i grew out of the stage where i praise whatever thom yorke and co. decide to shit in my mouth and ok computer just is not as monumental as it used to be.,1
this cd is simply put the greatest album of all-time. there are absolutley no flaws here only perfection. it is simply amazing.,1
este foi um daqueles discos que comprei na altura da sada logo posso me gabar de ter gostado do lbum sem ter seguido a onda meditica que envolveu a banda.  primeira audio ainda fiquei apreensivo j que o som da banda tinha-se tornado mais frio e estranho them relao ao anterior the bends mas depois deu para perceber a evoluo qualitativa dos radiohead. houve uma evoluo conceitual que fez com que a msica de ok computer surjisse impregnada de impresses sobre o mundo moderno e os seus efeitos nefastos sobre o homem. bons exemplos disso so o conforto sufocante de no surprises a frieza de fitter happier ou a neurose e parania de paranoid android. musicalmente tambm foi muito marcante j que sem criar nada de verdadeiramente novo dentro do rock foi uma autntica lufada de ar fresco que provocou o fim da cansada cena da britpop. pessoalmente destaco dois momentos a energia espiritual de airbag que parece nunca se esgotar e o jangle rock melanclico das guitarras them letdown. momentos verdadeiramente perfeitos.,1
this is a monumental achievement in all musical aspects. for those of you who have not heard this album because of the hype surrounding it get over it and for the love of pete listen to it. it is a leap above all other albums put out in the 90s in terms of musicality depth and lyricism. it simultaneously sends you on a high and then slaps you back down to reality thanks to yorkes searing lyrics about modern man and commercialism. paranoid android is a symphony in itself.,1
i do not know where to begin other than to say that subterranean homesick alien is likely to remain my favourite radiohead song... although knowing radiohead there are strong contenders that will eventually bite me in the ass for saying that. but i digress.,1
this was voted the greatest album of all time on channel 4s 100 greatest albums and while i would not go as far as too call the greatest it still is a fab album. airbag is the best track on here and karma police is the best single. terrific.,1
my personal favorite album of the last 10 years. paranoid android may be the best modern rock recording period. this song still makes my neck hairs stand on end 8 years later...,1
if you have already heard it you know how good it is. if you have yet to hear it you probably think it is overhyped and cannot possibly be as good as everyone says it is. this is wrong. i normally buy albums have a few listens and promptly forget about them. this is one of the few albums that after the first listen i had to play it all over again then spent the next few months playing it everyday and buying every radiohead item i could find andor afford. all these years later it still has moments that blow me awaysend chills up my spinegive me goosebumpsplease add own cliche here. in saying that i find every album radiohead have done since this to be dreadfully dull miserable and boring. but that might just be me.,1
i used to love this album. a lot. but it seems i have listened to it a few times too many. guess it is time to move on. still a damn fine record. i would recommend it to anybody.,1
it is unfortunate that because of the hype surrounding ok computer that so many have taken the i have to listen to what other people are not listening to and bash what is popular stance on it even if the popularity of this album is mainly only among serious music lovers. there are not many britney spears fans listening to and enjoying this album so people need to stop bickering about whether it is too hyped and just examine the album for the music it contains. with that said the music on this album is extraordinary. people should listen to the hype because the sgt. peppers of the 90s comparisons are valid in many ways. while computer might not have the cultural impact of peppers it has had a similar impact on the music community with a brilliantly conceived and well executed concept about the dehumanization of people through machines. lyrically thoughtful and musically enjoyable especially on highlights like airbag paranoid android letdown karma police no surprises and lucky ok computer deserves its place as the 1 album of the 1990s. the fact that i just rattled off half the album as highlights should be a testament to its overall strength.,1
holy shit! man is this kick-ass album deep and thought provoking. every song on the album seems to interwine into each other to create a symphony of perfection and brilliance. this is my favorite album by my favorite artist. the bends are not too shabby neither.,1
radioheads ok computer is a masterpiece and one of the most beautiful albums ever done.,1
that is it sir. you are leaving. the crackle of pigskin. the dust and the screaming. the yuppies networking. the panic the vomit. the panic the vomit. god loves his children god loves his children yeah. nothing more needs be said on this album. you can thank me later for sparing the world any more of that. terribly over-hyped but for a reason. why not over-hype one of the best most creative albums ever recorded? you know the rest. highlights paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police no surprises,1
my overall favourite have all their albums this is a priceless album....kid a and their latest album are all amazing however might need a little getting used to....,1
this is the first radiohead album i was able to listen from the beginning to the end. at my first listen i did not like many tracks from it like airbag electrictioning and fitter happier. at that time i was only into the darker tracks such as lucky and exit music. but now i pretty much appreciate each single minute of this album and i guess it made me change my idea about the heavier rocking songs red by k.c. made me loose a lot of some of my prejudices against more fast and noisy songs as well. songs that i once could not stand like airbag coz i once considered to noisy are now definitely necessary to listen i am going to to appreciate the album entirely. i love the dark and a lot of times melancholic tone of this album. even kid a cannot be darker in my opinion and the creepy tracks from it are genuine artworks. lucky is so touching that it became my favorite radiohead song and the progressive track paranoid android is so eargasmic that i doubt any radiohead fan in this world would not have loved it at the first listen. airbag starts already rocking with soft and suave vocals by thom though and making your hair reach the ceiling with those great basslines and background sounds in an unforgetable intro that is as amazing as the intro of king crimsons album red and its instrumental is really strong and enjoyable. it does make a superb pair with the next track paranoid android which would be their progressivest song divided in 4 parts the first part starts very tranquil making a good usage of acoustic tones and soft vocals. then it slowly progresses into a heavier part and at the moment thom says you will remember you will remember!! best radiohead moment i am going to and it is even better in the live versions since he actually screams at that part the song shows his second face a stronger heavier one with a guitar work that is not 3rd grade as someone once qualified the guitarrists playing in this album. after the angry part a sad and melancholic tone arrives at your ears with very touching vocals by thom and amazing backing vocals as well. after it face 2 comes again and finishes the song with 5 stars leading to the next great tune... subterranean homesick alien starts very trippy with great guitar notes flowing with thoms again soft vocals and neat keyboard arrangements. this song creates a great atmosphere it is indeed very strong in terms of how you feel when listening to it. you can easily appreciate the complexity of its instrumental and thoms vocal work which become a bit melancholic at the second vocal section of the song. talking about melancholic the next track does make some tears born from your eyes...exit music was a music done for a movie and it starts as a guitar solo with the sad vocal work then it gets a slide guitar section until the end that reminds me a lot of the live versions of celestial voices by pink floyd. i do not enjoy the next track too much let down is a nice one and it is good since it makes the mood of the album a bit more shiny but it does not lose its melancholy tone mainly in the vocals which return in total power in karma police another great radiohead success from this album. fitter happier is interesting scary it is nice to listen to the robot talking with those creepy background instrumentals a nice song nothing so much special about it though...it is just different and therefore original. and then electionnering comes the most heavy one from the album it is a good track i once disliked it but it surprisingly grew on me as i said before i am losing my restrictions against heavier rocking songs. we then travel to climbing up the walls. is it just me or does this song have some elements for their other good album kid a? it really fits in kid as style except for the noisy part which is more rocky than what would look nice on kid a. anyway it is another song that can be appreciated it is creepy as most of the album and since it is creepy i really like it heheheh... er..ok...i guess it is time to take a nap with the next song...no do not shoot me ok? i am not saying the next song is boring i am saying that it has one of those go sleep child songs feel it is a very sweet song very beautiful and one of the first ones i listened to when i started my radiohead fan-craziness. thom again makes some beautiful and soft vocals here hell the guy is one of the best vocalists ever!! now let us talk about lucky. beautiful song? no. it is much more than this this is i am going to okcs best song and it is not only beautiful... it is very beautiful sad wrist cutting and tear producer track. it has 3 sections one with the trippy instrumental and thoms trippy vocals another just like the first one but with a very well done choir at the back of the song and a last one just like the second one but without thoms voice. there is an awesome guitar solo between the second and third parts that progresses to part 3 with the great choirs which sound a bit differently now shorter and less sad. and then there is the tourist a great track too with a sad tone almost as deep as the track before it is one. it is a great final for a great album which ends here...  so this is by far my favorite radiohead album their most trippy touching complex and musically agradable in my opinion and it is much more appreciated if listened to entirely not like the bends where it can also be enjoyed by listening to the tracks isolated.,1
bello  bello cazzo ma devo ancora capire se i radiohead siano la band epocale che si dice in giro o fuffa.,1
hard to get into for me but after all i find an extremely good album. kind of pink floyd-ish. excellent album. my favorite tracks ont this album are paranoid android and exit music for a film. crazy album.,1
muy pocos artistas tienen la capacidad de expresar sus sentimientos ntimos de tristeza y rabia como lo hacen thom yorke y compaia. adems la mayora de las composiciones son esplndidas y la produccin y arreglos muy originales. si te sientes deprimido mejor no escuches este disco y menos an el tema exit music for a film. el mejor disco de radiohead seguido por el fantstico the bends.,1
i am not sure what a flawless album sounds like but this cannot be too far off base,1
i would give this five but i am saving it for when some album transforms my life so its as good as five stars. what an album,1
damn those analogue fx,1
i always used to find radiohead dull when i was a casual music fan. i heard that karma police and paranoid android were two of their better songs but when i listened to them i just found them plain dull. then after getting sucked into the world of music more and more probably about a year later i gave those two songs another listen and was struck by how much i enjoyed them this time round. i was anxious to get my hands on a copy of the whole ok computer album and hear more of radioheads stuff. it is a bit clichd to say that this album is the best of the 90s or even the best of all time but for me personally there are only a select few albums that i prefer any which i rate 5 stars. most albums i might listen to for a few days after getting them but i could not stop listening to this for a couple of weeks. paranoid android and karma police are two amazing songs which are almost flawless and while it is based around a common theme there are songs with very differing tones like subterranean homesick alien and exit music for a film. as this is so hyped it is one of those which everyone needs to hear whether you hate it or love it. why does it not get five stars from me then? i like it but there is something about it that is preventing it getting the highest possible rating. paranoid android and karma police are perfect from start to finish but while there are not any bad songs a lot of them have parts that are amazing but also parts that are dull and boring. still an amazing album but not quite on a five star level.,1
this is for all you flamers radiohead is simply a band you get or you do not get. before comparing the members of this band to apes as one reviewer beautifully did you should actually look at the tabs for their songs. yes and please compare to the music that you ape comparers listen to. yes...that is what i thought. my first point is radiohead is unbelievably talented. my next point is that radiohead is excruciatingly creative to the point where you feel like pulling your hair out...because it is so creative. the lyrics are uncomprehendable the music will rip your heart out and rip at it...it is amazing. alright alright. this is not a review. i am just mad that people actually think radiohead is crap. i will admit it takes a liberal mind to like them. their music is controversial...no not in the way eminem was...it feels controversial. it is different and people are not always ready to accept that. ladies and gentleman we hope. that you choke. that you choke.,1
what i love about this album is that it does not offer a quick fifty odd minutes of pointless nonsensical fun. it has it is heartbreakingly beautiful moments it is pissed off moments and a bit of creepiness to top it off. it is challenging and happens to sound better with each listen. paranoid android is as close to perfection as any song can get. i love the lyrics and style changes. some might call this album depressing but i seriously do not find it to be so it actually lifts my spirit every time i hear it...even no surprises gets a smile out of me. every song on here is a highlight except fitter happier it is an interesting track but not one i could listen to again and again. ok computer certainly lives up to it is ridiculous hype and i have and will happily listen to it for a very long time.,1
ok computerthe 3rd album from radiohead.is it better than the bends?well i would have to say yes and scream it out passionately because i have no doubt about it that this album is better than the bends.which to be honest is a huge achievement because the bends is a near perfect albumbut this is a perfect album.not only are the songs all flawless but the meanings behind the songs always keep you coming back for more. the album i feel is quite distanced from anything on the bends and its fair to say that the songs are more complex.paranoid androidis a perfect example of this and i can see why people call it a modern bohemian rhapsody with better lyrics.never before have i seen an album that bursts with classic and famous songs like this doesmaybe nevermind comes near but when listening to ok computer you have a feeling that you have heard it somewhere beforea sure winner then. examples of this are the beautiful intro to no surprisesthe guitar work in paranoid androidand the chorus in karma police. i really cannot emphasize how much this needs to be in your collectionit is more than an albumit is the best album ever created.the meaningthe vocalsthe talent-it is perfect.my favorite album ever?......why go on then.my other favorite albums i may like but non-convey this emotion or imageryok computer should really be in the louvre museum in parisit is art of the highest form and i could talk about this album more and draw more meaning from it than i could with any painting. if you liked the bends buy this and then love radiohead and swallow up the whole collection like hundreds of others before havesomething i will do myself very soon.,1
this is one of the greatest albums of all time but definitely the best album of the 90s. radiohead is our led zeppelin so go and listen my children.,1
8 out of the 12 songs are solid solid solid. the album starts out with the highly underrated airbag. the guitars really drive this song and greenwoods ambient almost egyptian sounding guitar solo is purely amazing. the screeching sonic like sounds that are incorporated into this song at the end are worth the listen alone...paranoid android follows and the word classic is all that needs to be said. next we have subterranean homesick alien which i thought to be very vague repetitive and lacking energy. exit music for a film is a sad accoustical piece that was recorded for the film romeo and juliet. the song starts out slow and a bunch of eerie noises are incorporated towards the end which gives the song alot of energy and really transform the listener into the world of the capulets and montagues. letdown is one of the most soothing and uplifting tracks of this album. the guitar work is among the most melodic that i think i have ever heard. the song works towards an amazing buildup that will blow the listener away. karma police is a mundane jazzy like piano piece that is slow and dry until the last 130 when things really pick up and become energetic and really fun! another classic! the second half is not as good as the first. fitter happier was definetly a filler. electioneering is probably the worst track on the album. i felt it was way too political. climbing up the walls is very eerie and it takes you to a very very very dark place. no surprises is another melodic piece that uses a xylophone that sounds really cool. lucky is a great guitar piece with a really great solo. a choir piece is incorporated into the song and that really gives the song alot of feeling and energy. the last song the tourist i felt to be somewhat of a letdown. there is no energy at all and it almost makes you want to fall asleep. some people loved i was one who hated it.,1
